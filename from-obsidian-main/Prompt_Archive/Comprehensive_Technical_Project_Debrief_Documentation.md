## 📚 **What This Template Actually Is**

**Technical Project Debrief Documentation**: A complete record of how a technical project went from start to finish. 

**Real example**: After your company builds a new mobile app, this documentation covers "What worked well? What was harder than expected? What would we do differently? How much did it cost vs. budget?" It becomes a reference guide for future similar projects.

**Why you need it**: So you don't repeat mistakes and can build on successes for future projects. Large organizations use this for knowledge transfer, compliance documentation, and process improvement.
