## 🎯 What Is This?

The Debrief Machine is a prompt framework system that makes AI conversations actually useful later.

Instead of:
- Having great 2-hour Claude/ChatGPT sessions
- Forgetting everything 3 days later
- Re-reading 8,000 words to find one decision
- Re-solving problems you already solved

You get:
- 2-minute structured debrief at session end
- 800-word scannable summary instead of 8,000-word transcript
- Find insights in 30 seconds instead of 20 minutes
- Build on previous work instead of repeating it
