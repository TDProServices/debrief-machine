# FREE LITE VERSION STRATEGY - The Debrief Machine
## Market Validation & Lead Generation Plan

**Created:** November 19, 2025
**Purpose:** Design and implement free lite version for lead generation and market validation
**Expected Impact:** 50+ downloads in first 48 hours (validation metric)

---

## Executive Summary

The Debrief Machine's full v3.0 system contains 500+ lines of comprehensive prompts across 4 main editions (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Universal) plus 5+ specialized variants. The free lite version will extract 2-3 **core prompts** that:

1. **Show complete value** - Users can immediately capture insights from a session
2. **Work standalone** - No need to buy full version to benefit
3. **Create FOMO** - Enough omitted features to justify upgrade
4. **Validate market demand** - Track downloads as proof of market interest

---

## SECTION 1: RECOMMENDED PROMPTS FOR LITE VERSION

### PROMPT 1: Universal Session Debrief (Primary) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Status:** MUST INCLUDE - The core value proposition

#### What It Is
The fundamental prompt that works across ALL platforms (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot). This is the "minimum viable debrief" - the single most important prompt in the entire system.

#### Why It Works Standalone
- **Self-contained** - Doesn't require other prompts to function
- **Immediately useful** - User can paste it and get results in 5 minutes
- **Demonstrates core value** - Shows how to transform a 5,000-word session into actionable insights
- **Platform agnostic** - No version conflicts or compatibility issues

#### Key Features to Include
```
✓ Executive summary generation (3-5 key takeaways)
✓ Decision log (what was decided and why)
✓ Action items extraction (next steps)
✓ Key insights formatting (what changed your thinking)
✓ Resource/reference tracking (what was useful)
✓ Strategic questions for next session
✓ Copy-paste ready (zero editing required)
```

#### How to Extract From v3.0
- Source: `Universal Edition v3.0` section (lines 215-275 approx)
- Keep: Core ROLE definition, AUTO-TRIGGER DETECTION v3.0, BRIEFING GENERATION (simplified to 8-10 core sections instead of 27)
- Remove: Enterprise integration, compliance templates, cross-session memory features (save for paid)
- Add: Clear instructions for first-time users

#### Expected User Outcome
User starts with: Raw 7,000-word Claude conversation about a project
User finishes with: 2-3 minute briefing with all key decisions, takeaways, and next steps

---

### PROMPT 2: Claude Edition - Lite Version (Secondary) ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Status:** STRONGLY RECOMMENDED - Platform-specific optimization

#### What It Is
Claude-optimized version of the debrief prompt that leverages Claude's unique features:
- Project context awareness
- Artifact generation
- Canvas integration (when available)
- Superior reasoning for complex analysis

#### Why Include It
- **Dual value prop** - Shows what dedicated Claude optimization looks like
- **Demonstrates platform-specific benefits** - "See how much better it works with Claude?"
- **Works with Claude Projects** - Perfect for users already in Claude environment
- **Clear upgrade path** - "Want ChatGPT/Perplexity versions? Get the full package"

#### Key Features to Include
```
✓ Project continuity integration (uses Claude Projects memory)
✓ Artifact generation (auto-creates downloadable document)
✓ Enhanced trigger detection (auto-suggests debrief generation)
✓ Strategic question development
✓ Version tracking (for multi-session projects)
✓ Context inheritance (references previous conversations)
✗ Enterprise features (save for paid)
✗ Full compliance templates (save for paid)
```

#### How to Extract From v3.0
- Source: `Claude Project Edition v3.0` section (lines 28-155 approx)
- Keep: ROLE definition, AUTO-TRIGGER DETECTION (simplified), core BRIEFING sections (8-10 most useful)
- Remove: All 26 section references, enterprise integration, compliance framework
- Add: Quick "Claude Projects Step-by-Step" guide

#### Expected User Outcome
User: "I use Claude Projects for all my work sessions"
Result: Debrief prompt that works INSIDE Claude Projects, auto-generates artifacts, integrates with project memory
Insight: "Wow, this would be perfect for my workflow... but I want it for ChatGPT too"

---

### PROMPT 3: Choice #1 - Pick ONE Specialized Variant ⭐⭐⭐

**OPTION A: ADHD-Friendly Session Guide** (Recommended for ADHD market segment)

#### Why This One
- **Clear ADHD market** - 2-3M potential users in ADHD communities
- **Different problem statement** - Not just "capture insights" but "manage session overwhelm"
- **Teaching value** - Includes principles for ADHD-friendly documentation
- **Standalone appeal** - Works without knowing about other variants

#### Key Features to Include
```
✓ Brain-first design principles (immediate clarity, scannable structure)
✓ Session boundary clarity (chunking, discrete sessions vs projects)
✓ ADHD-friendly formatting standards (emoji headers, bullet emphasis)
✓ Quick "ready" checklist before ending a session
✓ Progress tracking without overwhelm
✗ Full timeline development framework (save for paid)
✗ Complete teaching guide (lite version: just essentials)
```

#### Source
- `ADHD-Friendly Teaching Guide v3.0` (from-external-1/Prompt_Archive/)
- Extract: First 100 lines covering "Core Philosophy" + "Session Documentation Principles" + "ADHD-Friendly Formatting Standards"
- Keep: Practical formatting examples, checklist
- Remove: Complete timeline development, Jupyter Labs integration, full session analysis framework

#### Expected User Outcome
- ADHD user: "Sessions feel overwhelming and scattered"
- Result: Clear, structured way to capture session progress with BRAIN-FRIENDLY formatting
- Insight: "This is designed for how my brain works... but does the full version have more organization tools?"

---

**OPTION B: Research-Focused Debrief** (Alternative for academic/researcher segment)

#### Why This One
- **Research-specific language** - "Methodology tracking", "reproducibility", "citation format"
- **50K researcher market** - Smaller but high-value segment
- **Publishing integration** - "How do I cite AI assistance?"
- **Compliance focus** - GDPR, HIPAA, research ethics built-in

#### Key Features to Include
```
✓ Research session documentation (methodology, datasets, findings)
✓ Reproducibility tracking (exactly what AI suggested vs. my idea)
✓ Citation format guidance (how to cite AI assistance in papers)
✓ Literature review tracking (sources referenced)
✓ Research ethics compliance
✗ Full enterprise compliance framework (save for paid)
✗ Complete institutional integration (save for paid)
```

#### Expected User Outcome
- Researcher: "How do I document AI use for publication?"
- Result: Structured format for research sessions that meets publishing standards
- Insight: "This solves a real problem in my workflow... are there more specialized versions?"

---

**OPTION C: Quick-Start Trigger Detection** (Alternative for power users)

#### Why This One
- **Shows "smart" features** - Auto-detection demonstrates advanced capability
- **Saves time** - Users don't need to manually decide when to debrief
- **Hints at fuller system** - "This is just the detection layer..."
- **Motivates upgrade** - "Imagine this auto-triggering for all your conversations"

#### Key Features to Include
```
✓ Completion pattern detection (12-15 indicators of session completion)
✓ Confidence scoring (high/medium confidence triggers)
✓ Manual activation with examples
✓ Works standalone (user doesn't need other prompts)
✗ Full automation (save for paid, hint at future integration)
✗ Cross-platform trigger aggregation (save for paid)
```

#### Expected User Outcome
- Power user: "I run so many conversations I forget to debrief"
- Result: Simple checklist - "Did you hit any of these patterns? Time to debrief!"
- Insight: "Smart detection saves time... what if this worked everywhere?"

---

## RECOMMENDATION: Which 3 Prompts to Include

**BEST COMBO for Market Validation:**
1. **Universal Session Debrief** (MUST HAVE - shows core value)
2. **Claude Edition - Lite** (SHOULD HAVE - shows platform optimization)
3. **ADHD-Friendly Session Guide** (RECOMMEND - largest secondary market, different use case)

**Why this combination:**
- **Two user segments reached** - AI power users + ADHD professionals
- **Demonstrates depth** - General purpose + specialized use cases
- **Creates FOMO** - "They have ADHD version, ChatGPT version available separately"
- **Shows product sophistication** - Not just one prompt, but platform/use-case specific variants
- **Validates market demand** - If ADHD version downloads spike, you know that market wants it

---

## SECTION 2: VALUE BALANCE STRATEGY

### The Dilemma
**Too much value** → Users never upgrade
**Too little value** → Users abandon (think it's broken/useless)

### Our Solution: The "Minimum Viable Debrief"

#### What's Included (Fully Functional)
```
✓ Core debrief prompt (captures all key information)
✓ 8-10 essential sections (executive summary, decisions, actions, next steps)
✓ One platform version (Universal + Claude)
✓ One specialized variant (ADHD or Research)
✓ Copy-paste ready, zero setup
✓ Works for small-to-medium sessions (5,000-15,000 words)
✓ All three work standalone (no dependencies)
```

#### What's NOT Included (Upgrade Incentives)
```
✗ ChatGPT Edition (separate product)
✗ Perplexity Edition (separate product)
✗ Full 27-section comprehensive briefing (FULL VERSION ONLY)
✗ Auto-trigger detection scoring system (FULL VERSION ONLY)
✗ Cross-session memory integration (FULL VERSION ONLY)
✗ Enterprise compliance templates (FULL VERSION ONLY)
✗ Autonomous project audit system (FULL VERSION ONLY)
✗ Advanced versioning logic (FULL VERSION ONLY)
✗ Research guide system (FULL VERSION ONLY - if not included in lite)
✗ 30+ additional prompts and variants (FULL VERSION ONLY)
```

### The Psychology of the Upgrade

**User Experience with Lite Version:**
1. **Hour 0:** Download free lite version
2. **Hour 1:** Paste main debrief prompt into Claude
3. **Hour 2:** Wow, this actually captures everything I needed
4. **Day 1:** Use Claude version for a project
5. **Day 2:** Start using ChatGPT for another project → "Hmm, wish I had the ChatGPT version"
6. **Day 3:** Share with ADHD friend, they ask: "Is there a better version?" → "Actually, yes..."
7. **Day 5:** Frustrated with manual debrief trigger → "I wish this auto-detected..."
8. **Decision point:** Pay $29 for full version with all platforms + auto-features

You're probably frustrated with the same problem I was:

"I just had a 2-hour conversation with Claude about [my project],
and it was amazing. But now I can't remember what we actually
decided, what the key insights were, or what I'm supposed to do next."

1️⃣ UNIVERSAL SESSION DEBRIEF - Paste this at the end of any
conversation and get:

   • Every decision + rationale
   • Action items for next session
   • Questions to explore next

2️⃣ CLAUDE PROJECT EDITION - If you use Claude Projects for work,
this integrates with your project knowledge and suggests when
you need to debrief.

3️⃣ ADHD-FRIENDLY SESSION GUIDE - If you're ADHD (or work with
ADHD brain patterns), this gives you brain-first structure that
doesn't add stress.

All three work standalone - copy, paste, get results in 2-5 minutes.

WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED (Get the full version for these):
→ ChatGPT + Perplexity optimized versions
→ Auto-trigger detection (knows when you need to debrief)

- GitHub README traffic: 100+ visitors (people exploring)
- Questions in Reddit comments: "How do I modify this for X?"
- Direct feedback emails: 2+ (people messaging about it)

**What this tells you:** "People find it useful, not just downloading and forgetting"

---

### Phase 3: Conversion Validation (Week 5-8)
**Goal:** Confirm people will pay for full version

**Metrics:**
- Paid sales: 3-10 sales ($87-$290 revenue)
- Email click rate: 10%+ of opens (people interested in paid version)
- Paid conversion rate: 2-5% of free downloaders (benchmark)
- Paid reviews/feedback: 2+ (quality signal)

**What this tells you:** "Market validated. This converts. Ready to scale."

---

### Red Flags (Stop & Pivot)
If after 4 weeks you see:
```
❌ <20 free downloads = Market probably doesn't exist yet
❌ <5% email open rate = Messaging not resonating
❌ 0 paid sales = Either not enough traffic OR pricing/positioning wrong
❌ Negative feedback = Product has real issues
```

**Action if red flags appear:**
1. Survey free downloaders: "Would you pay? Why/why not?"
2. Check your positioning: Maybe not AI power users, but researchers?
3. Try lower price ($19 instead of $29) to test elasticity
4. Survey Reddit comments for common objections
5. Pivot target market based on feedback

## SECTION 9: PRICING & EXPECTATION REALITY CHECK

### Free Lite Version
- **Price:** $0 (Free forever)
- **Commitment:** 3 core prompts, no updates (might add 4th later)
- **Expected downloads:** 300-1,000 in month 1
- **Revenue:** $0 (it's free)
- **Value:** Lead magnet + market validator

### Paid Full Version
- **Price:** $29 (test with $19/$29/$39 variants)
- **Commitment:** 30+ prompts, all platforms, future updates
- **Expected sales:** 9-25 in month 1 (depending on traffic)
- **Revenue:** $261-$725 month 1 (ramping up)
- **Realisti Year 1:** $3,000-$8,000 (honest projection)

### Why These Numbers?
- Market validation: Unproven product = conservative assumptions
- Single product: Gumroad data shows $500-1K/mo creators have 10-20 products
- No existing audience: Must drive 100% of own traffic
- Niche market: AI power users are real but not massive

### Path to $500/month
1. **Month 1-2:** Validate market exists (done with free lite)
2. **Month 3-6:** Build email list (free product + content marketing)
3. **Month 7-12:** Launch product suite (v3.0 Standard + expanded features)
4. **Month 13+:** Reach $500/month with 2-3 products + email marketing

---

### My Recommendation: **Option A (Minimal)**

**Why:**
1. **Fastest validation** - Get to market in 2 weeks
2. **Lowest risk** - Prove market exists before huge investment
3. **Best ROI** - 20 hours of work can generate $200-600 month 1
4. **Clear next step** - If market validates, upgrade to Option B/C
5. **Realistic timeline** - You have other projects, this is lean

**The Strategy:**
1. Build + launch bare-minimum free version (2 weeks)
2. Monitor metrics (is market interested? Do people convert?)
3. If YES (50+ downloads + 2+ paid sales) → Invest in Option B
4. If NO (< 20 downloads) → Pivot messaging/market before heavy investment

This follows the **HANDOFF principle from CLAUDE.md**: Market validation FIRST, heavy productization second.
