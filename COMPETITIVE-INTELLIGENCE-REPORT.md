**Revenue Potential: REALISTIC**
- ✅ $200-$400/month Year 1 achievable (7-14 sales/month)
- ✅ $500-$800/month possible with product suite
- ✅ Top creators earning $500-$5,000/month validates ceiling

**Risk Mitigation: STRUCTURED**
- ✅ Validate BEFORE heavy productization
- ✅ Free lite version → Beta → Full launch
- ✅ Multiple platforms (Gumroad, Etsy, Notion)
- ✅ Product suite expansion path

**RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED WITH VALIDATION**

**Next Steps:**
1. Create Free Lite version (2-3 prompts)
2. Launch validation campaign (Reddit, Twitter, landing page)
3. Collect 50+ emails in 48 hours
4. Survey willingness to pay $29
5. Only proceed to full productization if validation succeeds

**DO NOT spend 100+ hours organizing 935 files until market is validated.**
