## OUTPUT FORMAT

## 📖 How to Use This Prompt

### Step 1: Have Your AI Session
Work with your AI tool (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) on whatever project/question you have. Nothing changes in your normal workflow.

### Step 2: At the End of the Session
When you've completed your conversation and have your answers/artifacts/decisions, copy the entire prompt above (the part between the code blocks).

### Step 3: Paste and Run
Paste the prompt into your AI chat and press Enter. The AI will generate a structured debrief of your entire conversation.

### Step 4: Save the Output
Copy the AI's debrief response and save it to a file:
- Suggested naming: `debrief-YYYY-MM-DD-project-name.md`
- Example: `debrief-2025-11-16-api-architecture.md`

### Step 5: Reference Later
When you need to remember what you decided or continue the project later, read the debrief instead of re-reading the entire conversation.

**Time to run debrief:** 2 minutes
**Time saved later:** 15-30 minutes every time you reference it

## ⚡ Quick Q&A Debrief (For Shorter Sessions)

For quick technical questions or short sessions under 2,000 words:

```markdown

2. **ANSWER:** What was the solution/recommendation?
3. **KEY POINTS:** 2-3 most important things to remember
4. **CODE/ARTIFACTS:** Any code snippets or examples (if applicable)
5. **FOLLOW-UP:** What I should explore next (if applicable)

Keep it concise and scannable.
```
