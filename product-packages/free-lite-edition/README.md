# The Debrief Machine - Free Lite Edition

**Transform your AI conversations into structured, reusable documentation in 2 minutes.**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

1. **Have your AI session** with Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, or any AI tool
2. **At the end**, copy-paste the Universal Debrief Prompt
3. **Save the output** as `debrief-YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
4. **Reference it later** instead of re-reading the full conversation

**Time investment:** 2 minutes per session
**Time saved later:** 15-30 minutes every time you need to reference it

---

## 📁 What's Included

### 1. Universal Debrief Prompt
**File:** `universal-debrief-prompt.md`

The core debrief framework that works with any AI platform. Copy-paste at the end of sessions to get:
- Executive summary (3-5 key points)
- Key insights (what matters most)
- Decisions made (with rationale)
- Action items (prioritized)
- Open questions (what's unresolved)
- Useful artifacts (what was created)
- Next session starter (seamless continuity)

### 2. Quick Q&A Debrief
**Also in:** `universal-debrief-prompt.md`

Simplified version for short sessions (under 2,000 words):
- Question asked
- Answer received
- Key points to remember
- Code/artifacts (if any)
- Follow-up suggestions

## 📖 How It Works

### The Problem:
You have incredible 2-hour sessions with Claude or ChatGPT. Generate amazing insights. Make important decisions.

3 days later: **"Wait, what did I decide about that?"**

You scroll through 8,000 words trying to find one key insight. 15 minutes later, you give up and just re-ask the question.

### The Solution:
Run a debrief prompt at the end of each session. Get a structured 800-word summary instead of re-reading 8,000 words.

**Before Debrief:**
- 8,000-word conversation
- Need to find key decision 3 days later
- Spend 15-20 minutes scrolling/skimming
- Still miss important details

**After Debrief:**
- Same conversation + 2-minute debrief
- Need same information 3 days later
- Read "Decisions Made" section (30 seconds)
- Find exact answer with full context

**Net benefit:** 18 minutes saved + actually useful info

## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Multi-Session Projects
**Problem:** You work on Project A, switch to Project B for 2 weeks, return to Project A. You forgot everything.

**Solution:** Read Project A's debrief. 2 minutes later, you're back in context. No archaeology required.

---

### Use Case 2: Team Communication
**Problem:** After 2-hour AI planning session, you need to brief your team on what was decided.

**Solution:** Share the debrief. They get executive summary, key decisions, and action items without sitting through your 2-hour session.

---

### Use Case 3: Preventing Re-Work
**Problem:** You solved a complex problem with AI last month. This month, same problem appears and you can't remember the solution.

**Solution:** Search your debriefs folder for keywords. Find the solution in 30 seconds instead of re-solving for 30 minutes.

## 📂 Organization Best Practices

### File Naming:
Use format: `debrief-YYYY-MM-DD-project-name.md`

**Good examples:**
- `debrief-2025-11-16-market-research.md`
- `debrief-2025-11-15-auth-architecture.md`
- `debrief-2025-11-14-content-strategy.md`

**Why this format:**
- Chronological sorting (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Immediately see what it's about (project-name)
- Easy to search (consistent pattern)

### Folder Structure:
```
/Documents/AI-Debriefs/
├── 2025-11-16-project-alpha.md
├── 2025-11-15-market-analysis.md
├── 2025-11-14-code-refactor.md
├── 2025-11-13-legal-research.md
└── ...
```

### Search Strategy:
- **By date:** Sort folder by filename
- **By keyword:** Use Spotlight/Everything/grep to search content
- **By project:** Use consistent project names in filenames

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### Step 1: Normal AI Session
Nothing changes. Work with Claude/ChatGPT as usual.

### Step 2: End of Session
When you're done, copy the Universal Debrief Prompt and paste into chat.

### Step 3: Save Output
Copy the AI's response, paste into a new file:
```
/Documents/AI-Debriefs/debrief-2025-11-16-topic.md
```

### Step 4: Future Reference
When you need to remember what you decided or continue the project:
1. Open the debrief file
2. Scan relevant sections (Executive Summary, Decisions, Action Items)
3. Get answer in 30 seconds vs 15 minutes

### Step 5: Project Continuation (Optional)
If continuing the project in a new AI session:
1. Copy the "Next Session Starter" text from debrief
2. Paste into new chat
3. AI immediately has context without re-explaining

## ⚡ Power User Tips

### Tip 1: Create Debrief Hotkey
If you use the same AI tool frequently:
- Save the Universal Debrief Prompt to a text expander
- Assign hotkey (e.g., `;;debrief`)
- Type hotkey, instant prompt

### Tip 2: Link Related Debriefs
If a project spans multiple sessions:
```markdown
# Project Alpha - Session 2 Debrief

**Related Sessions:**
- [Session 1 - Planning](debrief-2025-11-10-project-alpha-planning.md)
- Session 2 - Architecture (this file)
- Session 3 - TBD
```

### Tip 3: Tag Important Decisions

After generating 200+ hours of AI conversations and forgetting 90% of them, I built the Debrief Machine to solve my own session management crisis. Now I actually remember what I talked about with Claude last week.
