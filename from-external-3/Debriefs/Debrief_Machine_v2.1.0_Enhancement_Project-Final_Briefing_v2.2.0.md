## 🎯 **Next Session Objectives**

1. **🚀 Production Deployment**: Upload all artifacts to project knowledge and begin real-world usage validation
2. **📊 Testing Framework**: Implement systematic testing of auto-trigger accuracy and strategic questions effectiveness
3. **🔄 Feedback Systems**: Establish user feedback collection and continuous improvement processes
4. **📈 Performance Monitoring**: Begin tracking success metrics and calibrating system parameters
5. **📚 Documentation Enhancement**: Create user onboarding guides and troubleshooting resources

## 📐 **Technical Specifications**

### **Auto-Trigger Scoring Algorithm**
```
High Confidence (15+ points) = Auto-generate briefing
- "I'm done" / "Let's wrap up" / "Execute that" (5 pts)
- 3+ artifacts created with completion status (4 pts)
- Explicit milestone completion statement (3 pts)
- Project delivery confirmation (3 pts)

Medium Confidence (8-14 points) = Ask permission
- 2+ artifacts created (3 pts)
- Major decisions finalized (2 pts)
- "That looks good" / "Perfect" responses (2 pts)
- Next steps clearly defined (2 pts)
```

### **Smart Versioning Logic**
```
Per-Project Versioning:
1. Search project knowledge: "debrief version project briefing"
2. Search current chat: "briefing v" OR "version"
3. Apply increment logic:
   - First debrief in project = v1.0
   - Second debrief in same chat = v1.1
   - First debrief in new chat = v2.0
   - Continue incrementing per project
4. Add ISO timestamp: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ
```

### **Platform Optimization Matrix**
- **Claude**: Artifacts, project knowledge, comprehensive automation
- **ChatGPT**: Strategic reasoning, Canvas support, business analysis  
- **Perplexity**: Research focus, source verification, fact-checking
