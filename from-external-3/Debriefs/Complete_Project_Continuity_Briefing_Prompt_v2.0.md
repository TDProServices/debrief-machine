**Output format:** Markdown, H-level headings, tables, and bullet lists. Use playful emoji dividers between major sections (🌟, 📋, 🛠️, 🚀, etc.) — but keep the content professional and clear. Do NOT omit any section; if something doesn't exist, write "-- none yet --".

- Add 1-2 sentence explanation BEFORE every table/section describing what it contains
- Include Status columns in all tables where applicable
- Clearly distinguish between inputs (Reference Materials) and outputs (Project Files)
- Add Canvas Index section

## 🎯 Formatting & Style Rules

1. **No fixed length limits** — be as detailed as necessary
2. **Every list/table row** must include BOTH a Topic label and a Timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ, assume America/New_York if unspecified)
3. **Make tables chat-friendly** (wrap text, no giant cells)
4. **Keep tense consistent**; avoid external commentary; output only the briefing
5. **Section explanations required** — Add 1-2 sentences before each table explaining what it contains
6. **Status tracking** — Include status columns where applicable to track progress
7. **Input vs Output clarity** — Reference Materials = inputs that inform the project; Project Files = outputs created by the project
