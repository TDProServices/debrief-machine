```bash
# Initialize in your vault
git init
git add .obsidian/
git commit -m "Initial vault setup for copyright documentation"

# For each project milestone
git add Assets/
git commit -m "Project milestone: [description of human creative work]"
git tag "v1.0-human-foundation"
```

### 3. Automated Backup Strategy
**Obsidian Sync + External Backup:**
