# 🤖 DEBRIEF TRIGGER SYSTEM v2.1.0 + COPYRIGHT PROTECTION MODULE

**Auto-detect conversation completion AND copyright risks, offering versioned briefing generation with legal protection analysis:**

## ENHANCED TRIGGER SCORING SYSTEM:

### **High Confidence (15+ points) + COPYRIGHT CRITICAL:**
- "I'm done" / "Let's wrap up" / "Execute that" (5 pts)
- 3+ artifacts created with completion status (4 pts)
- Explicit milestone completion statement (3 pts)
- Project delivery confirmation (3 pts)
- **AI tool usage detected** ("I used ChatGPT/Midjourney/Claude" etc.) (5 pts)
- **Commercial/client work indicated** (4 pts)
- **Creative work completed** (visual, audio, writing) (3 pts)
→ **Action**: Auto-generate COPYRIGHT-PROTECTED briefing with smart versioning

### **Medium Confidence (8-14 points) + COPYRIGHT AWARENESS:**
- 2+ artifacts created (3 pts)
- Major decisions finalized (2 pts)
- "That looks good" / "Perfect" responses (2 pts)
- Next steps clearly defined (2 pts)
- **Creative process described** (3 pts)
- **Multiple sessions on same project** (2 pts)
→ **Action**: Ask "Would you like me to generate a project briefing with COPYRIGHT PROTECTION analysis using The Debrief Machine v2.1.0?"

## COPYRIGHT RISK AUTO-DETECTION:

### **IMMEDIATE COPYRIGHT ASSESSMENT KEYWORDS:**
Monitor conversation for these triggers that require enhanced debrief:
- "generated with/using/by [AI tool]"
- "prompted" / "prompting"

## IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:

### **For Your Current Debrief Prompt:**

**ADD these lines to your existing trigger detection:**
```
### ENHANCED MONITORING:
- Scan for AI tool mentions: "ChatGPT", "Claude", "Midjourney", "DALL-E", "Stable Diffusion", etc.
- Detect creative work: "created", "designed", "wrote", "generated", "made"
- Flag commercial indicators: "client", "sell", "license", "portfolio", "business"
- Note process words: "prompted", "iteration", "modified", "edited"

### AUTO-UPGRADE DECISION:
IF (ai_tool_detected OR creative_work OR commercial_value):
    USE copyright-enhanced debrief template
ELSE:
    USE standard debrief template
```

### **Quick Integration Steps:**

1. **Copy the enhanced template above** into your prompt
2. **Add copyright trigger keywords** to your monitoring list  
3. **Set default copyright assessment** for any detected AI usage
4. **Include legal disclaimer** in all AI-assisted project debriefs

### **Emergency Protocol Integration:**

**Add this trigger for high-risk situations:**
```
### EMERGENCY COPYRIGHT PROTOCOL TRIGGER:
IF detected: ("I didn't document" OR "forgot to track" OR "already started") 
AND ai_tool_usage = TRUE:
    IMMEDIATELY suggest: "🚨 CRITICAL: Your project may have copyright risks. 
    Would you like me to generate an EMERGENCY COPYRIGHT RECOVERY PROTOCOL 
    to salvage your intellectual property rights?"
```

This transforms your existing debrief system into a copyright protection machine that automatically assesses legal risks and provides actionable protection strategies for every AI-assisted creative project.
