🔄 CONTINUOUS REVIEW & IMPROVEMENT OF ALL EXISTING ARTIFACTS

UPDATE all existing artifacts by consolidating ALL references into unified [1]-[N] numbering, adding missing research questions to existing research sections, expanding deliverables tracking in existing sections, adding file cleanup recommendations to existing file management areas, enhancing compliance verification in existing audit sections.

Then systematically review/critique ALL UPDATED existing artifacts based on discussion accuracy, best practices, effectiveness, morality, legality, compliance.

Then implement/act on improvements by UPDATING all existing artifact sections.

Then review/critique all existing artifacts again with even higher standards.

Then implement improvements in all existing artifacts again.

Repeat this cycle until 100% sure you've included 99% of conversation and ALL EXISTING ARTIFACTS are comprehensive.

Each iteration must:
- Identify specific improvements to ALL EXISTING ARTIFACT sections
- Implement all improvements in ALL EXISTING ARTIFACTS before next cycle  
- Raise quality standards higher than previous cycle across ALL artifacts
- Continue until NO significant improvements remain in any existing artifact
- Achieve 99%+ confidence in comprehensive coverage across ALL artifacts

NEVER create new artifacts. UPDATE all existing artifacts through improvement cycles until absolute certainty achieved.
