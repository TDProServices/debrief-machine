🔄 CONTINUOUS REVIEW & IMPROVEMENT PROTOCOL

Systematically review artifacts against source files, consolidate ALL references into unified [1]-[N] numbering, identify knowledge gaps with research questions, track ALL deliverables across project phases, recommend file cleanup, conduct quality review until 97%+ confidence, verify compliance.

Then systematically review/critique all artifacts based on discussion, best practices, effectiveness, morality, legality, compliance.

Then implement/act on improvements identified.

Then review/critique again with even higher standards.

Then implement improvements again.

Repeat this cycle until 100% sure you've included 99% of conversation and all objectives completed.

Each iteration must:
- Identify specific improvements
- Implement all improvements before next cycle  
- Raise quality standards higher than previous cycle
- Continue until NO significant improvements remain
- Achieve 99%+ confidence in comprehensive coverage

NEVER stop at first attempt. Continue review → implement → review → implement cycles until absolute certainty achieved.

CREATE MULTIPLE ARTIFACTS IF NEEDED TO PREVENT TRUNCATION.
