2. **Use Phase 2** when you need comprehensive documentation
3. **Use Phase 3** when ready to move from analysis to action

### **ADHD-Friendly Benefits:**
- **Progressive disclosure** - get what you need when you need it
- **Cognitive load management** - no overwhelming walls of text
- **Action-oriented focus** - clear next steps at every phase
- **Scannable structure** - quick visual hierarchy for information location
