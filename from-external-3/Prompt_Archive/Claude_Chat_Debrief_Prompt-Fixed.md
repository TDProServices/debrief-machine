SMART VERSIONING LOGIC:
1. Search project knowledge: "debrief version project briefing"
2. Search chat history: "briefing v" OR "version"
3. Auto-determine version number:
   - No previous debriefs = v1.0
   - Previous briefings found = increment appropriately
4. Include ISO timestamp: 2025-07-20T19:45:00Z

TASK: Generate comprehensive project briefing from conversation, formatted as downloadable artifact with strategic continuation planning.

REQUIREMENTS:
• Title: Project Name – Project Briefing v[VERSION]
• Include timestamp: **Generated**: [TIMESTAMP_ISO]
• Bold key insights, use emoji headers, status columns in ALL tables
• **MUST OUTPUT AS CLAUDE ARTIFACT** for easy download/sharing
• Add strategic questions for next chat continuation
