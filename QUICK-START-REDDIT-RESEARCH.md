## Success Criteria (30-Minute Version)

You've validated the market if:
- ✅ Found 5+ independent users describing similar pain
- ✅ At least 2 posts have 50+ upvotes or 20+ comments
- ✅ Found posts from 2024-2025 (recent)
- ✅ Users describing current workarounds (proves pain is real)
- ✅ Users are already paying for AI tools (willingness to pay)

You should STOP and reconsider if:
- ❌ Only found 1-2 mentions total
- ❌ All posts have <10 upvotes
- ❌ Only old posts (2022-2023)
- ❌ Users seem happy with free solutions
- ❌ No evidence anyone would pay

---

## What to Do After 30 Minutes

### If Validation is STRONG:

✅ **Next step:** Deep dive (2 hours)
- Complete full template in PAIN-POINT-QUOTES.md (15 quotes)
- Fill out PAIN-POINT-ANALYSIS.md
- Create MARKETING-LANGUAGE-GUIDE.md
- Draft landing page copy

✅ **Then:** Create free lite version
✅ **Then:** Run Reddit validation post

### If Validation is WEAK:

⚠️ **Next step:** Deeper investigation or pivot
- Search 5 more subreddits (r/Obsidian, r/productivity, r/Notion, etc.)
- Try different search terms
- Look for adjacent pain points
- Consider: Is this really a $29 problem? Or a $5 problem? Or not a problem?

⚠️ **Decision point:** Invest more research time or pivot to different product idea?

### If Validation is MIXED:

🔍 **Next step:** Hypothesis testing
- What specific segment has the pain? (AI power users? ADHD? Researchers?)
- What specific use case? (Work? Research? Learning?)
- What price point makes sense? ($9? $29? $49?)
- Should we niche down? (Claude-only? ADHD-specific? Research-focused?)

## Pro Tips for Fast Research

1. **Use Reddit's "sort by: relevance"** first, then check "sort by: top" for high-engagement posts

2. **Read comments, not just posts** - pain points often emerge in discussions

3. **Look for "workaround" discussions** - these prove the pain is real and current solutions are inadequate

4. **Check user profiles briefly** - are they AI power users? Professionals? Students? (market fit check)

5. **Screenshot good posts** - you might want to reference exact formatting/context later

6. **Copy exact URLs** - makes it easy to revisit or share

7. **Note the date** - recent = current pain, old = might be solved

8. **Watch for "I'd pay for..." comments** - direct willingness to pay signal

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Confirmation bias** - Don't only capture quotes that support your idea. If you find evidence the pain doesn't exist, capture that too.

❌ **Cherry-picking high-engagement** - One post with 500 upvotes doesn't validate a market. Look for multiple independent mentions.

❌ **Ignoring dates** - A highly-upvoted post from 2021 might describe a pain point that's already solved.

❌ **Missing the comments** - The post title might not show pain, but comments often reveal struggles.

❌ **Not capturing exact language** - Your marketing should echo user words. Capture quotes exactly.

❌ **Stopping at confirmation** - Find 5 quotes that support your idea? Good. Now find 5 that might contradict it. Full picture = better decisions.

## Time-Saving Shortcuts

### Google Search (faster than Reddit search)

Use Google with site:reddit.com to search multiple subreddits at once:

**Example:**
```
site:reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI OR site:reddit.com/r/ChatGPT "save conversation"
```

This searches both subreddits simultaneously.

### Reddit Advanced Search Operators

**Recent posts only:**
```
save conversation after:2024-01-01
```

**High engagement only:**
```
save conversation score:>50
```

**Combine:**
```
save conversation after:2024-01-01 score:>50
```

## Templates for Quick Capture

### Bare Minimum Quote Capture

```
Q1 | r/ClaudeAI | Nov 2024 | 67↑
"I'm losing 80% of value from Claude sessions - no good way to save insights"
Pain: knowledge retention
Link: [url]

Q2 | r/ChatGPT | Oct 2024 | 143↑
"Spent an hour finding which conversation had that Python solution. Built-in search sucks."
Pain: organization/search
Link: [url]
```

This is bare minimum but enough for 30-minute validation.

### Quick Synthesis Template

```
QUICK SYNTHESIS (30-min research)

Found pain? YES / NO

#1 Pain point: [theme]

User language:
- "[phrase 1]"
- "[phrase 2]"
- "[phrase 3]"

Current workaround: [what they do now]

Would they pay? [evidence]

Confidence: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

Next step: [deep dive / more research / pivot / stop]
```

---

## Example: Good 30-Minute Research

**Scenario:** You spent 30 minutes and found:

- 7 quotes from r/ClaudeAI and r/ChatGPT
- 3 posts with 50+ upvotes
- All from 2024
- Common theme: "can't find which conversation had X"
- Current workaround: manual copy-paste (described as "tedious")
- Users already paying $20/month for AI tools

**Interpretation:** ✅ STRONG validation signal

**Next step:**
1. Invest 2 hours in deep research
2. Create free lite version this week
3. Run validation experiment next week

---

## Example: Weak 30-Minute Research

**Scenario:** You spent 30 minutes and found:

- 2 mentions across all subreddits
- Both posts have <10 upvotes
- One from 2022, one from 2023
- Users seem satisfied with built-in export
- No evidence of willingness to pay

**Interpretation:** ❌ WEAK validation signal

**Next step:**
1. Try 5 more subreddits to be sure
2. If still weak, pivot to different product idea
3. Don't spend 100 hours organizing files for non-existent market

---

**Set your timer. Start your research. You'll know in 30 minutes if this is worth pursuing.**

**Ready? Go to r/ClaudeAI and search "save conversation" right now.**
