## 📊 **RESEARCH TRIGGER SCORING SYSTEM**

### **HIGH-CONFIDENCE RESEARCH TRIGGERS (15+ points):**
- "Research complete" / "Analysis finished" / "Conclusions reached" (5 pts)
- 5+ authoritative sources verified and cited (4 pts)
- Methodology documented with source quality assessment (3 pts)
- Research questions fully addressed with evidence (3 pts)
→ **Action**: Auto-generate research briefing with full source verification

### **MEDIUM-CONFIDENCE RESEARCH TRIGGERS (8-14 points):**
- 3-4 credible sources gathered and analyzed (3 pts)
- Initial findings documented with preliminary conclusions (2 pts)
- Research methodology partially established (2 pts)
- Key research questions identified but not fully explored (2 pts)
→ **Action**: Ask "Would you like me to generate a research briefing using the Research-Focused Debrief Machine v2.1.0?"

### **LOW-CONFIDENCE RESEARCH TRIGGERS (1-7 points):**
- Exploratory research phase with limited sources (2 pts)
- Background research gathering without analysis (1 pt)
- Single source analysis or fact-checking (1 pt)
→ **Action**: Continue research, suggest additional verification

## 🔍 **RESEARCH-SPECIFIC VERSIONING**

1. **Search project knowledge**: "research briefing version methodology analysis"
2. **Search chat history**: "research v" OR "analysis version" OR "findings brief"
3. **Auto-determine research version**:
   - No previous research briefings = v1.0-Research
   - Previous research briefings found = increment with -Research suffix
4. **Include research metadata**: ISO timestamp + methodology indicator

### **Research Version Examples:**
- v1.0-Research (Initial research completion)
- v1.1-Research (Updated findings with new sources)
- v2.0-Research (Major methodology change or scope expansion)
