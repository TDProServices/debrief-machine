## 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION (Benefit-Focused, 3-5 Paragraphs)

### Version A: AI Power User Focus

You just spent 3 hours in an incredible Claude session solving a complex problem. The conversation produced breakthrough insights, refined your strategy, and mapped out a clear action plan. Then you close the tab.

**Two days later, you can't remember the key decisions or why you made them.**

The Debrief Machine solves this. It's a comprehensive prompt system that transforms messy AI conversations into structured, actionable documentation in under 2 minutes. No more re-reading 10,000-word chat logs to find that one brilliant insight. No more losing strategic decisions in conversation sprawl.

**What you get:** A battle-tested framework refined over 8 months across 200+ real sessions. Copy-paste ready prompts for Claude, ChatGPT, and Perplexity that extract executive summaries, key decisions, action items, research questions, and strategic next steps—automatically organized into 26 comprehensive sections. Works with Claude Projects for cross-session memory, includes auto-trigger detection for hands-free operation, and comes with specialized editions for ADHD support, legal work, and academic research.

**The transformation:** From "Where did I see that insight?" to instant recall of every valuable conversation. From scattered thoughts to systematic knowledge building. From paying $20/month for AI tools to actually *capturing* the value they create.

If you're already invested in AI tools ($240/year for Claude Pro or ChatGPT Plus), this is the missing piece that ensures you actually retain and act on what you learn. Your future self will thank you.

---

### Version B: ADHD-Friendly Focus

Your brain moves fast. You have 17 tabs open, 3 Claude conversations running, and you're switching between them like a caffeinated hummingbird. Each conversation is brilliant—full of insights, strategies, and "I should definitely remember this" moments.

**But your executive function said "absolutely not."**

The Debrief Machine is your external memory system for AI sessions. It's a prompt that does what your ADHD brain struggles with: systematically extracting decisions, action items, and key learnings without forcing you to re-read thousands of words. Think of it as your AI conversation summarizer, task extractor, and "what was I even working on?" recovery tool—all in one.

**What makes it ADHD-friendly:** Zero setup required (copy-paste and go), works in 2 minutes when you're ready to move on, automatically detects when you're done (no need to remember to debrief), creates clear next-step lists (no ambiguity), and includes a special ADHD edition with executive function support built in. Plus, it works across all your AI tools—Claude, ChatGPT, and Perplexity—so you don't have to remember different systems.

**What you get:** 40+ copy-paste prompts refined over 8 months, platform-specific editions (Claude Project integration, ChatGPT optimization, Perplexity formatting), specialized variants (ADHD-friendly, research-focused, legal edition, tech projects), and a comprehensive system that turns "I know we discussed this" into "Here's exactly what we decided and why."

**Real talk:** If you're using AI tools for body-doubling, task breakdown, or strategy sessions, you need this. Every ADHD productivity coach recommends capturing insights immediately—this does it for you automatically. No willpower required, just results.

Your scattered genius deserves to be captured, not lost to tab-switching chaos.

---

### Version C: Researcher Focus

You're using Claude to analyze literature, brainstorm methodologies, and refine your arguments. The AI is invaluable—it challenges your assumptions, suggests alternative frameworks, and helps you think through complex problems. But as journals increasingly require AI disclosure and reproducibility documentation, you're facing a problem:

**How do you systematically track and cite AI contributions to your research?**

The Debrief Machine creates reproducible, citable records of your AI-assisted research sessions. It extracts research questions explored, methodologies discussed, assumptions made, alternatives considered, and key findings—all formatted as structured documentation you can reference in papers, share with advisors, or include in reproducibility statements.

**What makes it research-ready:** Comprehensive reference tracking (every source mentioned, organized and linked), decision logging with full rationale (why you chose Method A over B), assumption documentation with confidence levels (what the model assumed and impact if wrong), experiment tracking (what you tested, results, learnings), and citation-ready formatting for AI disclosure requirements.

**What you get:** Research-focused edition optimized for academic workflows, literature review templates, methodology session documentation, cross-session project tracking (connect multiple conversations on the same research question), and compliance-ready formatting for journals requiring AI transparency. Works with Claude Projects for literature review continuity across weeks or months.

**The academic reality:** You're already using AI for research. The question isn't whether to use it—it's how to document it professionally. This gives you systematic, reproducible, defendable records of AI-assisted work that meet journal standards and advisor expectations.

Stop scrambling to reconstruct what Claude suggested three weeks ago. Start building a documented, citable research process from day one.

---

### Version D: Universal (Recommended for Gumroad)

**Stop losing insights from your AI conversations.**

You just had a breakthrough session with Claude or ChatGPT. Three hours of strategic thinking, problem-solving, and "I should definitely write this down" moments. Then you close the tab and move on to the next thing.

Two days later, you vaguely remember the insights but can't recall the details, the decisions you made, or the action items you identified. Re-reading 10,000 words of conversation isn't an option—you barely have time to breathe.

**The Debrief Machine solves this in under 2 minutes.**

It's a comprehensive prompt system that transforms messy AI conversations into structured, actionable documentation. Copy-paste one prompt, and get a 26-section briefing with executive summaries, key decisions, action items, research questions, and strategic next steps—all organized, ready to review, and saved for future reference.

**What makes it powerful:**
- **Battle-tested framework:** Refined over 8 months across 200+ real sessions with Claude, ChatGPT, and Perplexity
- **Platform-optimized:** Specific editions for Claude Projects (with cross-session memory), ChatGPT, and Perplexity
- **Auto-trigger detection:** The system detects when you're done and offers to debrief automatically (no need to remember)
- **Specialized variants:** ADHD-friendly edition (executive function support), research-focused (academic citation-ready), legal edition (compliance documentation), tech projects (development tracking)
- **Copy-paste ready:** Zero setup, zero configuration—just paste and run

**What you get:** 40+ prompts covering every use case, comprehensive documentation (quick start guide, examples, FAQ), lifetime updates (new LLM versions, improved prompts), and platform-specific optimization guides.

**Who this is for:**
- **AI power users** paying $20/month for Claude Pro or ChatGPT Plus who want to actually capture and retain insights (not just generate them)
- **ADHD knowledge workers** struggling to extract action items and next steps from long conversations
- **Researchers and academics** needing reproducible, citable documentation of AI-assisted work
- **Anyone** who's ever said "Where did I see that brilliant idea Claude suggested last week?"

**The transformation:** From scattered insights to systematic knowledge. From "I know we discussed this" to "Here's exactly what we decided and why." From paying for AI tools to actually *capturing* the value they create.

If you're already spending $240/year on AI subscriptions, this $29 one-time purchase ensures you get your money's worth. Your future self will thank you.

## 3. VALUE PROPOSITIONS (3 Distinct Versions)

### A. For AI Power Users

**Unique Hook:** This is the only systematic framework for capturing cross-session AI insights with version tracking, memory integration, and strategic question evolution.

---

### B. For ADHD Knowledge Workers

## 5. FAQ (5-7 Common Questions/Objections)

### Q1: Why not just ask Claude/ChatGPT to "summarize our conversation"?

**A:** Generic summaries miss 80% of what matters. They give you high-level overviews, but skip:
- The specific decisions you made and WHY you chose Option A over B
- The strategic questions you identified for future exploration
- The assumptions the AI made that might need validation
- The action items with clear ownership and dependencies
- The version history showing how your thinking evolved

The Debrief Machine captures all of this in a structured, consistent format across all your sessions. After 200+ iterations, we've identified the 26 sections that actually matter for knowledge retention and project continuity.

**Think of it this way:** A summary tells you *what happened*. A debrief tells you *what to do next*.

---

### Q2: I already take notes during sessions. Why do I need this?

**A:** You probably take great notes on what YOU think is important. But you're also:
- **In the flow state** during sessions (missing 30-40% of valuable details)
- **Biased toward your original questions** (missing the surprising insights)
- **Not capturing AI assumptions** (which can bite you later)
- **Inconsistent across sessions** (good notes on Monday, scattered by Friday)

The Debrief Machine is systematic and comprehensive every single time. It's not replacing your notes—it's catching everything your notes miss. Use it as your "second pair of eyes" that reviews the entire conversation objectively.

**Bonus:** Many users run the debrief, then use THAT as the starting point for their personal notes. It's faster and more complete than manual note-taking.

---

### Q3: Does this work with [insert AI tool name]?

**A:** Included platform support:
- ✅ **Claude (all versions):** Full optimization with Projects integration
- ✅ **ChatGPT (3.5, 4, 4o):** Threading and memory handling
- ✅ **Perplexity:** Research-focused formatting
- ✅ **Universal edition:** Works with any LLM that accepts long prompts

**Coming soon:** Gemini optimization, custom LLM edition (for self-hosted models)

If you're using a different tool, start with the Universal edition—it works with 95% of modern LLMs. We're actively adding support for new platforms based on customer requests.

---

### Q4: How long does it take to run a debrief?

**A:**
- **Paste prompt:** 10 seconds
- **AI generates debrief:** 30-90 seconds (depending on conversation length)
- **Review output:** 30-60 seconds
- **Total:** Under 2 minutes for most sessions

**Compare this to:**
- Re-reading the entire conversation: 10-30 minutes
- Manually extracting action items: 5-15 minutes
- Reconstructing decisions from memory: "Wait, why did we decide that again?"

**The 2-minute investment saves you hours** in review time, rework, and "I know we covered this" frustration.

---

### Q5: What if I don't finish sessions in one sitting? (I have multiple conversations on the same topic)

**A:** This is exactly what the **Cross-Session Memory Integration** feature handles:

1. **Claude Projects users:** The system automatically searches project knowledge for related conversations and links them in your debrief
2. **All platforms:** Each debrief includes a "Strategic Questions for Next Chat" section that preserves momentum
3. **Version tracking:** Sessions are numbered (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0) so you can see the evolution of your thinking
4. **Copy-Forward Blurb:** Every debrief includes a ready-to-paste prompt for your next session with full context preserved

**Example workflow:**
- Session 1: Initial exploration → Debrief generates strategic questions
- Session 2: Paste copy-forward blurb → Claude remembers context → Deeper dive → Debrief links back to Session 1
- Session 3: Full project history preserved → Continue building on previous insights

This is **way more powerful** than trying to remember what you covered three sessions ago.

---

### Q6: Is this just for work projects, or can I use it for personal AI sessions?

**A:** Works for ANY meaningful AI conversation:
- ✅ **Work projects:** Strategy, planning, decision-making
- ✅ **Learning sessions:** Research, skill development, course planning
- ✅ **Personal development:** Life decisions, goal setting, therapy-adjacent work
- ✅ **Creative work:** Writing brainstorming, story development, design ideation
- ✅ **Health & wellness:** Nutrition planning, exercise programming, ADHD management
- ✅ **Financial planning:** Investment research, budgeting, major purchase decisions

**The rule of thumb:** If the conversation is important enough that you'd be frustrated forgetting it, it's worth debriefing.

Many users debrief 80% of their AI sessions because the 2-minute cost is so low compared to the "I wish I had captured that" regret.

---

### Q7: What if the debrief is too long or misses important stuff?

**A:** The system includes enhancement prompts specifically for this:

**If output is too long:**
- Use the "Executive Summary Only" variant (3-5 bullet points)
- Use the "Quick Debrief" prompt (10 sections instead of 26)
- Customize section selection (include only what you need)

**If it misses something:**
- Use the "Enhancement Prompt" to add missing context
- The system includes a "Model Assumptions" section that flags what it might have missed
- You can re-run with specific instructions ("focus more on technical decisions")

**Reality check:** After 200+ iterations, the 26-section format captures 95%+ of what matters for most sessions. But we include customization options for edge cases.

**Also included:** A troubleshooting guide with solutions for "too verbose," "missed key points," "wrong format," and other common issues.

## 10. MARKETING COPY FOR DIFFERENT CHANNELS

### Reddit Post (r/ClaudeAI, r/ChatGPT)

**Title:** "I built a prompt system to capture insights from long AI sessions – here's the free Lite version"

**Body:**
I've been using Claude for deep work sessions (strategy, research, problem-solving) and kept losing valuable insights because re-reading 10,000-word conversations isn't realistic.

So I built The Debrief Machine – a comprehensive prompt that extracts executive summaries, key decisions, action items, and strategic questions in under 2 minutes.

**What it does:**
- Analyzes your entire conversation
- Generates 26 structured sections (or quick 5-bullet summary)
- Captures decisions + rationale (not just "what" but "why")
- Creates "Strategic Questions for Next Chat" to preserve momentum
- Works with Claude Projects for cross-session memory

**Free Lite version:** [Gumroad link to free tier]
**Full collection (40+ prompts, specialized editions):** [Gumroad link to $29 paid]

Happy to answer questions! I've refined this across 200+ real sessions, so I've probably hit most edge cases.

### Twitter Thread

**Tweet 1:**
You just had a brilliant 3-hour Claude session. Strategic insights, breakthrough ideas, clear action plan.

Then you closed the tab.

Two days later: "Wait, what did we decide again?" 🤦

I built a system to fix this. Here's how it works 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The Debrief Machine is a prompt that turns messy AI conversations into structured documentation.

Copy-paste one prompt → Get comprehensive briefing in 2 minutes.

No more re-reading 10,000 words to find one decision.

**Tweet 3:**
What it captures:
✅ Executive summary (bold bullets, no fluff)
✅ Key decisions + WHY you chose them
✅ Action items (clear ownership)
✅ Strategic questions for next session
✅ Assumptions made (flag what needs validation)

26 sections total, all organized.

**Tweet 4:**
Platform-specific optimization:
- Claude Projects: Cross-session memory integration
- ChatGPT: Threading and conversation history
- Perplexity: Research-focused formatting

Plus specialized editions for ADHD, research, legal work, and tech projects.

**Tweet 5:**
I've refined this across 200+ sessions over 8 months.

## 11. OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS

### Objection: "This seems expensive for a prompt"

**Response:**
Fair question! Here's the value breakdown:

**What you're getting:**
- 40+ prompts (not just one) = $0.72 per prompt
- 8 months of refinement across 200+ sessions
- Platform-specific optimization (would take you weeks to figure out)
- Specialized editions (ADHD, research, legal, tech) = 4 products in one
- Lifetime updates as new LLMs emerge

**Time savings:**
- Saves 10-30 minutes per session in review time
- If you debrief just 10 sessions, that's 3-5 hours saved
- At even $25/hour value of your time = $75-125 in time saved

**Compare to:**
- One month of Claude Pro: $20 (this is one-time $29)
- Notion template (similar complexity): $19-49
- AI productivity course: $79-299

**Bottom line:** If you have one AI session per week worth remembering, this pays for itself in the first month. After that, it's pure value.

---

### Objection: "I can just build my own prompt"

**Response:**
Absolutely! You totally can. Here's what that looks like:

**Time investment:**
- Research what sections matter: 5-10 hours
- Test with different conversation types: 10-15 hours
- Optimize for different LLMs: 5-8 hours
- Handle edge cases (short sessions, multi-part conversations): 3-5 hours
- **Total: 23-38 hours of work**

**Opportunity cost:**
- At $25/hour value of time = $575-950 in opportunity cost
- At $50/hour = $1,150-1,900

**What you get here:**
- Battle-tested across 200+ sessions (edge cases already solved)
- Platform-optimized (Claude Projects integration, ChatGPT threading, etc.)
- Specialized variants you probably wouldn't build (ADHD, research, legal)
- Free updates when new LLMs emerge

**The real question:** Is spending 30+ hours reinventing this a better use of your time than spending $29 and using it today?

Most people who ask this question start building, get frustrated after 5 hours, and come back. Save yourself the hassle. 😊

---

### Objection: "What if I don't use it enough to justify the cost?"

**Response:**
Great question – let's do the math:

**Break-even point:** You need to save 1-2 hours of time to justify $29.

**How you save time:**
- Re-reading conversations: 10-30 min per session → 2 min with debrief
- Remembering decisions: "Wait, why did we choose that?" → Instant recall
- Context-switching: "What was I working on?" → Strategic questions preserved

**Realistic usage:**
- 1 debrief per week = 52 per year = $0.56 per use
- 2 debriefs per week = 104 per year = $0.28 per use
- 1 per month = 12 per year = $2.42 per use

**Even at 1 per month, you're saving 10-30 minutes per use.** That's 2-6 hours saved per year. Worth way more than $29.

**Plus:** It's one-time payment, not subscription. Buy once, use forever. Even if you only use it occasionally, it's there when you need it.

**Real talk:** If you're having AI conversations important enough to worry about cost-per-use, they're important enough to document. Don't let $29 be the reason you lose a $10,000 insight.

**If reviews <4.5 stars:**
