5. Publish on Tuesday or Wednesday 9-11 AM ET

**Reference:** SETUP-INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md (Substack section)

---

#### 4. Reddit Community Building + Post (2-3 hours)
**CRITICAL:** Must follow 90/10 rule or risk ban

**Monday-Tuesday (BEFORE posting promotional content):**
- [ ] Join r/ClaudeAI
- [ ] Read ALL subreddit rules
- [ ] Comment helpfully on 9-10 threads (NOT about Debrief Machine)
- [ ] Build presence as genuine community member

**Wednesday (After 48 hours of helpful contributions):**

|------|--------|-----------|---------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Nov 19 | r/ClaudeAI | 12 | 23 | 8 | Mostly positive | 2 feature requests |
| Nov 20 | Substack | 18 | - | 3 | All positive | 1 upgrade question |

**Go/No-Go Decision Friday:**
- ✅ GO (Proceed to Week 2): 50+ downloads, 70%+ positive sentiment
- ⚠️ MAYBE (Adjust & Retry): 20-50 downloads, mixed feedback
- ❌ NO-GO (Pivot or Stop): <20 downloads, negative feedback

**Reference:** NEXT-STEPS.md (Week 1 metrics section)

---

## Research Findings Summary

### Key Insights That Changed Strategy

1. **Pricing Optimization:** Research shows $47/$77 (instead of $49/$79) increases conversion 24%
   - **Recommendation:** Update pricing in all docs before Week 2 launch
   - **Files to Update:** gumroad-product-descriptions.md, landing-page-copy.md, PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md

2. **Reddit 90/10 Rule:** CRITICAL for avoiding ban
   - **Must Do:** 9-10 helpful comments Monday-Tuesday BEFORE Wednesday promotional post
   - **Risk:** Posting promotional content without 90% contribution history = instant ban

3. **Demo Video:** Increases conversion 20-30%
   - **Priority:** Week 2 (after validation)
   - **Time:** 1-2 hours to record (script already written)

4. **Free-to-Paid Benchmark:** 2-5% is realistic
   - **Validation:** Our 2%+ target is achievable
   - **Expectation:** 100 free downloads → 2-5 sales at $29

5. **Email Sequences:** Behavior-based > time-based
   - **Update:** Add segmentation tags (cold/warm/hot) in ConvertKit
   - **Priority:** Week 3-4 (after initial sales)

**Full Research:** See RESEARCH-FINDINGS-ADDENDUM.md

## Remaining Gaps (5%)

### What I Could Not Complete Autonomously

**Due to Login Requirements:**
- Product images creation (requires Canva account)
- Gumroad upload (requires Gumroad account)
- Substack publishing (requires Substack account)
- ConvertKit setup (requires ConvertKit account)
- Google Analytics setup (requires Google account + Carrd)

**Due to Validation Constraint:**
- Standard Edition extraction (blocked until Week 1 validates: 50+ downloads)
- Requires 5-8 hours of file reading and organization
- Ready to execute immediately if user says "Week 1 validated, proceed to Week 2"

**Due to Human Judgment Required:**
- Product image aesthetics (requires visual design decisions)
- Testimonial collection (requires relationship building with customers)
- Video recording (requires on-camera presence or screen recording)

**Due to Software Development Required:**
- Obsidian plugin (60-80 hours development)
- Browser extension (100-150 hours development)
- Team Edition SaaS (200+ hours development)

**These gaps are EXPECTED and APPROPRIATE** - they require user authentication or human skills that cannot be automated.

---

## Confidence Assessment

### Overall Project Completeness: 95%

**What's 100% Complete:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Market Validation Content (4/4 deliverables)
- ✅ Phase 2: Competitive Research (5/5 deliverables)
- ✅ Phase 3: Documentation (7/7 deliverables)
- ✅ Phase 4: GitHub Issues (17 issues documented)
- ✅ Additional research (4 critical areas, 20 citations)
- ✅ Task assessment (all 17 issues analyzed)

**What's 5% Incomplete:**
- Product images (user must create in Canva)
- Actual Gumroad upload (user must do via browser)
- Actual Substack publish (user must do via browser)
- Actual Reddit post (user must do via browser)
- Standard Edition extraction (blocked on Week 1 validation)

**This 5% gap is INTENTIONAL** - these tasks require user authentication or validation-first constraint compliance.

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 2-3 Hours)
1. User commits and pushes this final status document
2. User verifies all commits pushed: `git log origin/claude/debrief-machine-validation-012chChGWvnLR8UYou2qcJnz..HEAD` (should show nothing)
3. User reviews PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md for complete context
4. User reviews SETUP-INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md for Week 1 tasks

### Week 1 (Monday-Friday)
**Monday:**
- Create Canva images (2-3 hours)
- Create Gumroad account and upload Free Lite Edition (30 min)
- Join r/ClaudeAI, start commenting helpfully (1 hour)

**Tuesday:**
- Continue Reddit community building (1 hour, 5+ more helpful comments)
- Create Substack account, draft article with images (30 min)
- Verify Gumroad download link works (5 min)

**Wednesday:**
- Publish Substack article 9-11 AM ET (5 min)
- Post on Reddit r/ClaudeAI 9-11 AM ET (15 min)
- Set reminder to check comments every 2-4 hours

**Wednesday-Friday:**
- Respond to Reddit comments authentically (30 min-1 hour/day)
- Track metrics daily (5 min/day)
- Document feedback and objections

**Friday EOD:**
- Make go/no-go decision based on metrics
- If GO (50+ downloads): Message AI agent "Week 1 validated, proceed to Week 2"
- If MAYBE (20-50 downloads): Adjust messaging, try different subreddit
- If NO-GO (<20 downloads): Analyze why, decide pivot vs stop

### Week 2 (If Week 1 Validates)
**User says to AI:** "Week 1 validated with [X] downloads, proceed to Week 2"

**AI agent will autonomously:**
1. Extract Standard Edition prompts from 293 files (5-8 hours)
2. Organize into platform-specific editions (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity)
3. Create specialized variants (ADHD, Legal, Technical, Academic)
4. Package as ZIP files
5. Write README files
6. Commit and push

**User will:**
1. Create paid Gumroad listings using extracted product files
2. Record 1-minute demo video (script available in future commit)
3. Build Carrd landing page (copy available in landing-page-copy.md)
4. Set up ConvertKit or Gumroad Workflows for email sequences
