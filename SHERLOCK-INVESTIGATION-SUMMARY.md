## What You're Looking For

### Evidence of Real Pain

**Strong signals:**
- Multiple users describing same frustration independently
- High engagement (50+ upvotes, 20+ comments)
- Emotional language ("losing", "frustrated", "can't find")
- Users seeking solutions actively
- Detailed workarounds (proves pain is real)

**Weak signals:**
- One-off mentions
- Low engagement
- Casual observations without emotion
- Satisfaction with current solutions

### Willingness to Pay Indicators

**Direct evidence:**
- "I'd pay for..."
- "Where can I buy..."
- "Take my money"

**Indirect evidence:**
- Already paying for AI tools ($20/month)
- Professional/work context (have budgets)
- Describing time cost ("spend hours...")
- Quantifying value loss ("losing 80%...")

### User Language Patterns

**Capture exact phrases:**
- How do they describe the problem?
- What words do they use? (conversation, session, chat, thread?)
- What's the emotional language? (frustrated, overwhelmed, lost?)
- What outcome do they want? (organize, remember, find, reference?)

**This language becomes your marketing copy!**

---

## Analysis Framework

### Theme Categories to Track

1. **Session/Context Management**
   - Switching between conversations
   - Tracking what was discussed where
   - Organizing multiple projects

2. **Knowledge Retention**
   - Forgetting insights
   - Unable to reference past conversations
   - Lost value from AI sessions

3. **Workflow Integration**
   - Need to integrate into existing tools
   - Manual copy-paste frustration
   - Lack of structure

4. **Search/Retrieval**
   - Can't find specific conversation
   - Can't search within conversations
   - No way to organize for future reference

5. **Multi-Project Management**
   - Juggling multiple AI threads
   - Confusion about context
   - Need for project-based organization

### Count Mentions

For each theme:
- How many quotes mention it?
- What's the average intensity (low/medium/high)?
- Which subreddits mention it most?
- What language do users use?

**The #1 theme = your primary value proposition**
**The #2-3 themes = secondary value props**

---

## Decision Tree After Research

### If You Find STRONG Validation:

✅ **Signals:**
- 10+ independent mentions across subreddits
- Multiple high-engagement posts (50+ upvotes)
- Recent posts (2024-2025)
- Clear willingness to pay indicators
- Inadequate current solutions

✅ **Next steps:**
1. Complete all three templates
2. Update MARKET-ANALYSIS-AND-POSITIONING.md
3. Create free lite version this week
4. Draft landing page copy
5. Run Reddit validation post next week
6. Build Standard version if validation succeeds

✅ **Timeline:** Launch in 2-3 weeks

---

### If You Find MODERATE Validation:

⚠️ **Signals:**
- 5-10 mentions across subreddits
- Some engagement but not high
- Mix of recent and older posts
- Some workarounds seem adequate
- Unclear willingness to pay

⚠️ **Next steps:**
1. Expand search to 5+ more subreddits
2. Look for specific niche segment (ADHD-only? Claude-only? Researchers?)
3. Consider lower price point ($9-19 instead of $29)
4. Test free lite version before building Standard
5. Run pricing survey before committing

⚠️ **Timeline:** More research + 4-6 weeks to launch

---

### If You Find WEAK Validation:

❌ **Signals:**
- <5 mentions total
- Low engagement (<10 upvotes)
- Only old posts (2022-2023)
- Users satisfied with free solutions
- No willingness to pay evidence

❌ **Next steps:**
1. Do NOT spend 100 hours organizing 935 files
2. Try 5 more adjacent subreddits to be sure
3. If still weak: PIVOT to different product idea
4. Consider: Is this a real problem? Or just your assumption?

❌ **Timeline:** Stop or pivot immediately

---

## Integration with Existing Project Docs

After completing research, update these files:

### 1. MARKET-ANALYSIS-AND-POSITIONING.md
**Add section:**
- Reddit pain point research findings
- User language and messaging
- Validated vs. invalidated assumptions

### 2. ANALYSIS-TODO-LIST.md
**Update tasks:**
- Mark "Pain point research" as completed
- Add "Create free lite version for [#1 pain point]"
- Add "Draft landing page with user language"
- Reprioritize based on findings

### 3. Product Development Priority
**Based on research:**
- Which variant to build first? (Claude vs. ChatGPT vs. Universal)
- Which pain point to solve first?
- What should free lite version include?
- What's the #1 value prop for Standard version?

---

## Pro Tips from Professional Market Research

### 1. Avoid Confirmation Bias
- Don't only capture quotes supporting your idea
- Look for evidence that contradicts your hypothesis
- If you find people saying "built-in export is fine", capture that
- Full picture = better decisions

### 2. Context Matters
- A quote from a professional is different from a student
- AI power users are different from casual users
- Work context is different from personal use
- Check user profiles briefly for context

### 3. Recency is Critical
- 2024-2025 posts = current pain
- 2022-2023 posts = might be solved
- Old highly-upvoted posts can be misleading
- Sort by both "top" and "recent"

### 4. Comments > Posts
- Original posts might not show full pain
- Real struggles emerge in comment discussions
- Users share workarounds in comments
- Willingness to pay appears in comment threads

### 5. Engagement = Resonance
- 50+ upvotes = many people relate
- 20+ comments = active discussion = real pain
- 1-2 comments = might be individual issue
- Sort by "top" to find high-engagement posts

## Common Questions

### Q: "Can I use ChatGPT to help with research?"

**A:** Yes! Great idea:
1. Copy-paste Reddit posts into ChatGPT
2. Ask: "Extract pain points from these Reddit posts"
3. Ask: "What language patterns do you see?"
4. Ask: "Categorize these by theme"

But ALWAYS read posts yourself first - you'll catch nuances AI misses.

---

### Q: "Should I engage in discussions or just lurk?"

**A:** For research: Just lurk and capture.

For validation: After research, consider posting a "value post":
- "How do you all manage insights from AI sessions? I've tried X, Y, Z..."
- See what responses you get
- Soft-mention your solution if someone asks
- Track engagement

---

### Q: "What if I find competitors mentioned?"

**A:** GREAT finding! Capture:
- What product/solution was mentioned?
- What did users say about it (good/bad)?
- What features do they like?
- What's missing?
- What's the pricing?

This is competitive intelligence gold.

---

### Q: "How do I know if my sample size is enough?"

**A:** For initial validation:
- 5-10 quotes across 3-4 subreddits = sufficient for go/no-go
- 15-20 quotes across 5-6 subreddits = sufficient for deep analysis

You're not doing academic research. You're looking for signal strength.

If the pain is real and strong, you'll know within 10 quotes.

---

### Q: "What if different subreddits show different pains?"

**A:** Perfect insight! This helps you:
- Segment your market
- Create platform-specific messaging
- Decide which market to target first
- Build variant products (Claude vs. ChatGPT vs. ADHD-focused)

Different pains = opportunities, not problems.
