## 🎯 Strategic Priorities

### Priority 1: VALIDATE FIRST ✅
**DO NOT organize all 935 files until market is validated.**

If Week 1 fails (< 20 downloads), STOP and pivot. Don't waste 100+ hours on a product nobody wants.

### Priority 2: SPEED OVER PERFECTION ✅
Ship fast. Test. Iterate.

Week 1 deliverables don't need to be perfect. They need to be good enough to test interest.

### Priority 3: FEEDBACK LOOPS ✅
Listen to users. Every comment, every question, every objection is data.

Adjust messaging, positioning, pricing based on real feedback.
