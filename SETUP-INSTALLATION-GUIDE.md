## Reddit Setup (Community Marketing)

**Purpose:** Drive initial traffic and validate market interest
**Cost:** Free
**Time:** 10-15 minutes setup, 15-20 minutes per post

### Step 1: Create or Use Existing Reddit Account

1. Go to https://reddit.com
2. Sign up or log in
3. **Username:** Use a recognizable handle (not obviously promotional)
4. **Profile:** Add brief bio, not overly promotional

### Step 2: Join Target Subreddits

1. **r/ClaudeAI** (80K members) - Primary target
2. **r/ChatGPT** (500K+ members) - Secondary target
3. **r/ADHD** (1.9M members) - If using ADHD angle
4. **r/productivity** (2M+ members) - If using productivity angle

**Important:** Spend 30-60 minutes lurking in each subreddit before posting:
- Read the rules carefully (especially self-promotion policies)
- Understand the community tone and norms
- Look at top posts to see what resonates

### Step 3: Build Karma (If New Account)

If your account is brand new:
1. Comment helpfully on 5-10 posts in target subreddits
2. Don't mention your product yet
3. Be genuinely helpful
4. Build some karma (10-20 points minimum)

This prevents auto-mod removal and builds credibility.

### Step 4: Choose Your Post Variation

From `content-marketing/reddit-post-templates.md`, choose based on subreddit:

**For r/ClaudeAI:**
- Variation A: Problem-Solution Story (most recommended)
- Or Variation D: Claude-Specific Technical Angle

**For r/ChatGPT:**
- Variation B: Data-Driven Approach
- Or Variation C: Before/After Comparison

**For r/ADHD:**
- ADHD-Focused Variation
- Emphasize working memory and context switching

### Step 5: Post on r/ClaudeAI (Primary Target)

1. **Read subreddit rules again** (check sidebar or "About" tab)
2. **Timing:** Post on Tuesday or Wednesday morning (9-11 AM ET for peak activity)
3. **Title:** Use from template (e.g., "After losing track of 200+ Claude sessions, I built a system...")
4. **Body:** Copy from chosen variation, customize to your voice
5. **Add Gumroad link:**
```
You can download the free version here: [Debrief Machine Free Lite](https://gumroad.com/l/debrief-machine-free)
```

6. **Flair:** Use appropriate flair if available (e.g., "Tips & Tricks", "Resources")
7. Click "Post"

### Step 6: Engage Authentically

**Critical:** Set reminder to check post every 2-4 hours for first day

**When you get comments:**
- [ ] Respond within 2-4 hours
- [ ] Be helpful and genuine (not salesy)
- [ ] Answer questions thoroughly
- [ ] Thank people for feedback
- [ ] If criticism, acknowledge and improve

**Example responses:**

*Comment: "This seems useful but I already take notes manually"*
**Good response:**
```
That's great that you have a system! Manual notes definitely work, especially if you're organized. I built this because I found manual notes took me 15-20 minutes per session and I'd still forget to write down key decisions. The prompt generates a structured debrief in 2 minutes for me.

But if manual notes work for you, keep doing what works! Different approaches for different people.
```

**Bad response:**
```
Try my product, it's way better than manual notes!
```

### Step 7: Track Metrics

Create a simple spreadsheet:

| Date | Subreddit | Upvotes | Comments | Clicks | Downloads | Sentiment |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Nov 19 | r/ClaudeAI | 23 | 8 | ~50 | 12 | Mostly positive |

**Track:**
- Upvote count (20+ is good, 50+ is great)
- Comment count (10+ is engagement)
- Sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)
- Downloads from Reddit (ask in Gumroad analytics or use UTM parameters)

### Step 8: Post on Additional Subreddits (Optional)

**Wait 48 hours after r/ClaudeAI post**, then try:
- r/ChatGPT (if r/ClaudeAI was positive)
- r/ADHD (if using ADHD angle)
- r/productivity (if general productivity angle)

**Important:** Don't spam. Space posts out by 48+ hours and customize to each community.

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Posted on r/ClaudeAI
- [ ] 20+ upvotes (topic resonates)
- [ ] 10+ comments (engagement)
- [ ] 20-30 downloads in 48 hours
- [ ] Majority positive sentiment
