## Data Collection Template

For each quote/insight you find, capture this information:

```markdown
### Quote #[NUMBER]

**Source:** r/[subreddit] - u/[username] - [date]
**Post Title:** [title]
**Upvotes/Comments:** [X upvotes, Y comments]
**Context:** [What was the post about?]

**Quote:**
> "[exact quote from user]"

**Pain Point Theme:** [categorize: session mgmt / context loss / organization / etc.]
**Intensity:** [Low / Medium / High] (based on language used)
**Workaround Mentioned:** [What are they doing now?]
**Willingness to Pay:** [Any indication they'd pay for solution?]

**Marketing Language Extracted:**
- Key phrases: [words/phrases they used]
- Emotional triggers: [frustration/overwhelm/desire words]

---
```

---

## Analysis Framework

After collecting 10-15 quotes, analyze for:

### Theme Categories

1. **Session/Context Management**
   - How many quotes mention this?
   - What specific aspects? (switching, tracking, organizing)

2. **Knowledge Retention**
   - Forgetting insights
   - Inability to reference past conversations
   - Lost value from AI sessions

3. **Workflow Integration**
   - Need to integrate AI into existing tools
   - Manual copy-paste frustration
   - Lack of structure

4. **Multi-Project Management**
   - Juggling multiple AI conversations
   - Confusion about what was discussed where
   - Need for organization system

### User Language Patterns

**What words do users use?**
- Do they say "session" or "conversation" or "chat"?
- Do they say "insights" or "ideas" or "responses"?
- Do they say "organize" or "manage" or "track"?
- What emotional words appear? (frustrated, overwhelmed, lost, etc.)

**This language should appear in your marketing copy!**

### Engagement Metrics

- Posts with 50+ upvotes = strong resonance
- Posts with 20+ comments = active discussion
- Recent posts (2024-2025) = current pain point
- Recurring themes across subreddits = universal problem

### Current Solutions & Gaps

**What are people doing now?**
- Copy-paste to Notion/Obsidian (manual, tedious)
- Screenshots (not searchable, not structured)
- Nothing (losing valuable insights)
- Custom scripts/workflows (technical, fragile)

**Why are current solutions inadequate?**
- Too manual
- Not structured
- Not searchable
- Not reliable
- Too technical for average user

### Objection Identification

**Potential objections to your product:**
- "I can just copy-paste for free"
- "Built-in export should be enough"
- "I don't have that many important conversations"
- "Too expensive for a simple tool"

**How to counter (based on research):**
- Copy-paste doesn't capture structure/metadata
- Built-in export is raw text, not actionable
- Even 1-2 lost insights cost more than $29
- Time saved = ROI

## Success Criteria

You've found good data if:
- ✅ Multiple users expressing same frustration independently
- ✅ Posts with high engagement (50+ upvotes or 20+ comments)
- ✅ Recent posts (2024-2025) showing ongoing pain
- ✅ Users actively seeking solutions in comments
- ✅ Users describing willingness to pay for solution
- ✅ Users sharing elaborate workarounds (proves pain is real)

You might be off-target if:
- ❌ Only 1-2 mentions across all subreddits
- ❌ Low engagement on posts
- ❌ Only old posts (2020-2022)
- ❌ Users seem satisfied with free solutions
- ❌ No one responding to suggestions in comments

---

## Next Steps After Research

1. **Create PAIN-POINT-QUOTES.md** with raw data
2. **Create PAIN-POINT-ANALYSIS.md** with synthesis
3. **Update MARKET-ANALYSIS-AND-POSITIONING.md** with findings
4. **Draft landing page copy** using user language
5. **Create free lite version** targeting #1 pain point
6. **Test messaging** in Reddit comments (soft validation)

---

## Tips for Effective Research

1. **Sort by "relevance" AND "top"** - catches both targeted and popular posts
2. **Read comments, not just posts** - pain points often emerge in discussion
3. **Look for "workaround" threads** - proves problem is real
4. **Note the date** - recent = current pain, old = might be solved
5. **Check OP's profile** - AI power user? ADHD? Professional? (market fit)
6. **Capture exact quotes** - your marketing copy should echo user language
7. **Note what's NOT being said** - gaps in discussion = opportunities

## Example Good Quote

```markdown
### Quote #1

**Source:** r/ClaudeAI - u/ExampleUser - Nov 2024
**Post Title:** "How do you all manage important insights from Claude sessions?"
**Upvotes/Comments:** 127 upvotes, 43 comments
**Context:** User asking how others save/organize valuable insights from work sessions

**Quote:**
> "I've had so many breakthrough moments with Claude for my research, but I realize
> I'm losing 80% of the value because I don't have a system to capture and organize
> the insights. Copy-pasting to Notion is tedious and I forget to do it. By the time
> I need the insight again, I can't remember which conversation it was in. Has anyone
> solved this?"

**Pain Point Theme:** Knowledge Retention + Workflow Integration
**Intensity:** High (quantifies loss: "80% of the value")
**Workaround Mentioned:** Copy-paste to Notion (tedious, unreliable)
**Willingness to Pay:** Implied (actively seeking solution, research professional)

**Marketing Language Extracted:**
- Key phrases: "breakthrough moments", "losing value", "capture and organize", "can't remember which conversation"
- Emotional triggers: Loss aversion (80%), frustration (tedious), desire (system)
- Job-to-be-done: "Capture and organize insights so I can find them later"

**Comments showed:**
- 15+ people agreeing with same problem
- 8 different workarounds mentioned (all manual/inadequate)
- 3 people saying they'd pay for a good solution
```

This is exactly what you're looking for!
