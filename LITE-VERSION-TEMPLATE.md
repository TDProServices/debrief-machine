# THE DEBRIEF MACHINE - FREE LITE VERSION

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** November 19, 2025
**Status:** Free forever, forever updated

---

## 🎯 WHAT IS THIS?

You're holding 3 powerful prompts to turn your long AI conversations into **organized, actionable briefings**.

**The problem:** You have a great 2-hour conversation with Claude about a project. It's brilliant. But 3 days later, you can't remember what you actually decided, what the key insights were, or what you're supposed to do next.

**The solution:** These prompts capture everything automatically. In 2-5 minutes, you get:
- 5 key takeaways
- Every decision made and why
- Action items with next steps
- Strategic questions for future sessions

**Bonus:** These work with ANY AI platform - Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot, whatever you use.

---

## ✨ WHAT'S INCLUDED

✅ **Universal Session Debrief** - Works with any AI platform
✅ **Claude Project Edition** - Optimized for Claude Projects
✅ **ADHD-Friendly Session Guide** - Brain-first documentation

All three prompts work standalone. No dependencies. Copy. Paste. Get results.

---

## ⏱️ HOW TO USE (2 MINUTES)

1. **Have a conversation** with Claude/ChatGPT/Perplexity about anything
2. **At the end**, copy one of the prompts below
3. **Paste it** into your conversation
4. **Wait 30 seconds** for the debrief to generate
5. **Copy the output** and save it somewhere (your notes, Notion, etc.)

That's it. You now have a structured summary of everything you discussed.

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT FIRST

**What you're getting:** The core debrief system. Powerful, but simplified.

**What you're NOT getting** (available in paid version):
- ChatGPT Edition (separate optimization)
- Perplexity Edition (research-focused version)
- Auto-trigger detection (knows when to debrief automatically)
- 27-section comprehensive briefings (this version: 8-10 core sections)
- 30+ additional specialized prompts
- Enterprise templates
- [And more - see comparison below]

**The idea:** Try this free. If you use multiple AI platforms or want more depth, the full version is $29. If this lite version solves your problem, stick with it forever.

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT

**What you'll get when you use this prompt:**

```
# Session Debrief: Debrief Machine Product Strategy

## 1. 🌟 Executive Summary
- Validated that market exists for AI session documentation (via Reddit/community response)
- Pricing strategy: $29 one-time purchase (not subscription)
- Launch strategy: Free lite version → email list → paid version
- Timeline: 2-week launch cycle with clear metrics

## 2. 💬 What We Discussed
Created a complete go-to-market strategy for the Debrief Machine product,
including market validation, pricing, distribution, and CTA strategy.

## 3. ✅ Key Decisions Made
- **Free lite version:** 3 prompts (Universal, Claude, ADHD) vs 30+ in paid
  → Why: Validates market demand before heavy investment
- **Price point:** $29 one-time (not $49, not subscription)
  → Why: Balances profitability with accessibility
- **Lead magnet approach:** Free version collects emails for paid funnel
  → Why: Builds owned audience independent of platforms

## 4. 💡 Key Takeaways
- Market validation with free version is CRITICAL (don't build 100 hours without proof)
- Most successful Gumroad creators have 10-20 products (one product = limited income)
- ADHD market segment (2-3M users) is underserved, high-intent buyers
- Distribution via Reddit + GitHub more effective than paid ads early on

## 5. 📋 Action Items
- [ ] Extract 3 core prompts from v3.0 (8 hrs) - Next 2 days
- [ ] Write marketing copy (3 hrs) - By end of week
- [ ] Set up GitHub + Gumroad (4 hrs) - By end of week
- [ ] Launch Reddit posts (2 hrs) - Week 2
- [ ] Monitor metrics (1 hr/week) - Ongoing

## 6. 🔗 Resources & References
- CLAUDE.md - Project commitment guidelines
- MARKET-ANALYSIS.md - Revenue projections
- ADHD-Friendly Teaching Guide - For prompt 3
- Gumroad pricing data - $500-1K/mo creator baseline

## 7. ❓ Strategic Questions for Next Session
- How do we get initial 50 downloads for validation? (Reddit + GitHub specific tactics)
- What testimonials/social proof should we collect early? (Track this from day 1)
- When should we expand to ChatGPT/Perplexity editions? (After validation, not before)

## 8. 📌 Status
- ✅ Complete: Market analysis, positioning, pricing strategy
- 🔄 In Progress: Free lite version strategy document
- ⏳ To Do: Content extraction, Gumroad setup, Reddit launch
```

---

### WHY THIS PROMPT WORKS

This prompt works because it:
- **Captures structure** without being overwhelming
- **Forces focus** on what matters (decisions, takeaways, next steps)
- **Works standalone** (doesn't need context from previous prompts)
- **Creates exportable output** (ready to paste into notes/docs)
- **Scalable** (works for 1-hour sessions and 10-hour sessions)

---

---

# PROMPT 2: CLAUDE PROJECT EDITION - LITE

**Best for:** People using Claude Projects (Claude's built-in project management feature)
**Time to use:** 2-5 minutes
**Output:** Debrief with Claude Project context integration

**WHY THIS VERSION:**
Claude Projects have a unique feature: persistent project knowledge. This version leverages that. When you use this prompt inside a Claude Project, it can:
- Reference your project context automatically
- Suggest when you're ready to debrief (you approve it)
- Track versions across multiple sessions
- Build continuity between conversations

**If you use Claude Projects:** This version is way better than the Universal version. You'll notice it references project history and suggests strategic questions based on what you've done before.

## COPY THIS PROMPT EXACTLY:

```markdown
ROLE: Expert Conversation Analyst & Strategic Documentation Specialist
VERSION: The Debrief Machine v1.0 - Claude Project Edition
TIMESTAMP: 2025-11-19T12:00:00Z

## 🔄 FOR CLAUDE PROJECTS

You have access to this project's knowledge base. Before generating the debrief:
1. Briefly search project knowledge for "previous sessions" or "[project name] version"
2. Note any relevant prior context (what was done before?)
3. Include "progression from previous sessions" in the debrief

## 📝 TASK: Generate Project-Aware Session Debrief

Create a comprehensive debrief that captures not just THIS session, but how it fits
into the larger project timeline.

## 🎯 DEBRIEF STRUCTURE

### 1. 🌟 Executive Summary
2-3 bullets: What did THIS session accomplish? What's different from last session?
(Include: "From previous session: [what was done], now: [what's new]")

### 2. 💬 Session Context & Project Position
- What's the larger project this session is part of?
- Where are we in the overall timeline?
- How does this session move us forward?

### 3. ✅ Decisions Made This Session
List each decision:
- **Decision 1:** [What decided] → Why: [rationale]
  (Note if this builds on previous session decision)

### 4. 💡 Key Insights & Breakthroughs
What did we learn THIS session that changes how we approach the project?

### 5. 📋 Action Items
With dependencies and sequence:
- [ ] Action 1 (Owner: you/them) (By: date) [Depends on: prior session X]
- [ ] Action 2 (Owner: you/them) (By: date)

### 6. 🔗 Resources & References
Links and tools mentioned (with project relevance)

### 7. ❓ Strategic Questions for NEXT Session
Build on this session's learnings:
- Question 1: [What we learned → what to explore next]
- Question 2: [What we learned → what to explore next]

### 8. 📊 Project Timeline Status
- Session count: X of Y planned
- Completion percentage: [estimate]
- Next major milestone: [what's next in sequence]

### 9. 📎 Copy-Forward Prompt for Next Session

[Auto-generate a copy-paste-ready prompt that includes all context from this session,
so next session can start with full context already loaded. Make it 2-3 sentences.]

---

GENERATE NOW: Create the above debrief, using project knowledge where relevant.
Include how this session fits into the larger project story.
```

---

## WHY THIS WORKS FOR CLAUDE PROJECTS

Using this inside Claude Projects means:
- The prompt can reference your project knowledge automatically
- It suggests continuity from one session to the next
- You build a project timeline without manual effort
- Strategic questions build on previous sessions
- The "copy-forward prompt" makes next session seamless

**Real example:** If you're building a product over multiple sessions, each debrief will note "last session we validated the market, this session we refined pricing, next session we should..." - creating natural project flow.

# PROMPT 3: ADHD-FRIENDLY SESSION GUIDE

**Best for:** People who are ADHD or work with ADHD-friendly structures
**Time to use:** 2-5 minutes
**Output:** Brain-friendly documentation that doesn't overwhelm

**WHY THIS VERSION:**

ADHD brains process information differently. Traditional documentation (long paragraphs, dense walls of text) feels OVERWHELMING. This version uses:
- **Emoji headers** for visual anchoring (easier to scan)
- **Chunked information** (small pieces, not dense paragraphs)
- **Bold key points** (quick visual emphasis)
- **Clear boundaries** (start/end of session is clear)
- **Action-focused language** (what should I DO?)

This is the same power as the other prompts, but formatted for ADHD brains.

```markdown
ROLE: Expert ADHD-Friendly Session Analyst
VERSION: The Debrief Machine v1.0 - ADHD Edition
TIMESTAMP: 2025-11-19T12:00:00Z

## 🧠 BRAIN-FIRST DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Create documentation that works WITH ADHD brains, not against them.
- Immediate clarity > comprehensive detail
- Action-oriented > theoretical
- Scannable structure > dense paragraphs
- Session boundaries > overwhelming context

## 📝 SESSION ANALYSIS

### ⏱️ Session Metadata

- **Duration:** [How long was this conversation?]
- **AI Used:** [Claude/ChatGPT/etc]
- **Session Focus:** [One sentence: what was this about?]

### ✨ What We Accomplished (YOUR WINS)
**Bold each win:**
- **Win 1:** [Specific achievement] ✓
- **Win 2:** [Specific achievement] ✓
- **Win 3:** [Specific achievement] ✓

### 💡 Breakthrough Moments (AHA! moments)
If there were any insights that changed thinking:
- **Breakthrough 1:** [What changed] → **Why it matters:** [impact]
- **Breakthrough 2:** [What changed] → **Why it matters:** [impact]

### 📋 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW (ACTION ITEMS)

**IMMEDIATE (Next 24 hours):**

### ✅ SESSION COMPLETION CHECKLIST

- [ ] **Do I know what to do next?** (If no, ask "what should I do first?")
- [ ] **Is this documented clearly?** (If no, ask me to reorganize)
- [ ] **Am I excited/energized?** (If not, that's valid - take a break)

### 📌 HANDOFF NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION

[Quick 2-3 sentence note on what to pick up with next time you chat]

---

GENERATE NOW: Create the above using ADHD-friendly formatting.
Use emoji headers. Use bold. Keep text chunks small.
Make it scannable in 60 seconds.
```

---

## WHY THIS WORKS FOR ADHD BRAINS

- **Emoji headers:** Visual anchor points (easier to jump between sections)
- **Chunked bullets:** Each point is small, digestible
- **Bold emphasis:** Key info stands out without reading everything
- **Time estimates:** Not overwhelming ("~5 min" vs "spend hours")
- **Clear boundaries:** Each section has start and end
- **Action-focused:** "What do I DO?" not "Here's analysis..."
- **Checkbox completion:** Feels good to check boxes off (dopamine!)

**Real example:** A person with ADHD looks at this document and immediately sees:
- 🎯 What we did (emojis = quick orientation)
- ✨ What we accomplished (bold = dopamine hit, feels good)
- 📋 What I need to do (clear, actionable)
- ✅ Can I check this off? (yes = feels productive)

NOT: Dense paragraphs to read that feel like homework.

# FAQ

## 🤔 COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: Do I have to use ALL three prompts or just one?**
A: Just one! Pick the one that fits your workflow:
- Universal: Works everywhere, simplest
- Claude: If you use Claude Projects
- ADHD: If your brain works that way (it's worth trying!)

**Q: Can I use this with [my AI platform]?**
A: Universal version works with Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot, Gemini, basically anything.
The Claude version only works with Claude (obviously). The ADHD version works with any platform.

**Q: How long does the debrief take?**
A: 2-5 minutes. You paste the prompt, wait ~30 seconds while it generates, then copy the output.

**Q: Can I edit the prompts?**
A: 100%! These are just starting points. Customize them:
- Change "Executive Summary" to "Quick Recap" if you prefer
- Add or remove sections
- Adjust tone (formal vs casual)

**Q: Can I use this for work / commercial purposes?**
A: Yes! Use these however you want - personal projects, client work, business decisions, whatever.

**Q: What if I only use ONE platform (just Claude)?**
A: Use the Claude Edition. It's specifically optimized for Claude Projects and will feel more natural.

**Q: Is the paid version really necessary?**
A: Depends on your workflow:
- **Use free if:** You primarily use one platform, 3 prompts is enough, you don't need auto-detection
- **Upgrade to paid if:** You use multiple AI platforms, want deeper analysis, want auto-triggers, need specialized variants

**Q: How is this different from just asking Claude to "summarize this conversation"?**
A: This is structured, consistent, and built for ACTION:
- Not just "here's a summary" but "here's decisions, next steps, resources, questions"
- Consistent format every time (not random Claude output)
- Designed to be exported and referenced later (not just read once)
- Different versions for different platforms/needs (not one-size-fits-all)

**Q: Can I share this with my team?**
A: Yes! Share the free version with teammates. If your team wants the full version with all platforms, recommend the $29 version.
