# Stop Forgetting Your Best AI Conversations

You're having incredible 2-hour sessions with Claude, ChatGPT, and Perplexity. But can you remember what you talked about last week?

The Debrief Machine fixes this.

## What This Is

A prompt framework you paste into AI chat interfaces at the end of sessions. The AI summarizes itself into a structured format you can actually use later.

Takes **2 minutes** to run.
Saves **15-30 minutes** every time you need to reference that session.

## What's Included (FREE)

✅ **Universal Debrief Prompt** - Works with Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, any AI platform

✅ **Quick Q&A Debrief** - Simplified version for shorter sessions

✅ **Implementation Guide** - Step-by-step instructions, naming conventions, workflow tips

✅ **Before/After Examples** - Real-world use cases showing time saved

## The Problem

You've had 100+ amazing AI conversations. You can remember about 5% of them.

The rest disappeared into the void the moment you closed the tab.

**You're paying $20-40/month for AI tools. Are you actually keeping the value?**

## The Solution

Run a debrief prompt at the end of each session. Get a structured summary with:

- **Key insights** (the 3-5 ideas that actually matter)
- **Decisions made** (what you concluded and why)
- **Action items** (prioritized next steps)
- **Open questions** (what still needs research)
- **Next session starter** (paste into future chat for seamless continuity)

## Before/After

**Without Debrief:**
- 6,500-word conversation about API architecture
- 3 days later, colleague asks about authentication decision
- Spend 15 minutes scrolling and skimming
- Still miss key details
- Look unprepared

**With Debrief:**
- Same conversation, run debrief prompt (2 min)
- 3 days later, same question
- Open debrief file, scan "Decisions Made" section (45 seconds)
- Give complete, confident answer
- Look like you have it together

**Net benefit:** 18 minutes saved + actually useful info

## Who This Is For

✅ Claude Pro or ChatGPT Plus subscribers with long sessions
✅ ADHD knowledge workers who struggle with context-switching
✅ Researchers who need to document AI-assisted analysis
✅ Anyone who's thought "Wait, didn't I already solve this with Claude last month?"

## Try It Now

Download the free lite edition. Run it on your next AI session. See if it saves you time.

If you find it useful, there's a comprehensive paid version with platform-specific editions, specialized variants, and advanced features.

**No email required. Just download and use.**

# Transform AI Chaos Into Organized Insights (In 2 Minutes)

You're having brilliant sessions with Claude, ChatGPT, and Perplexity.

**But can you find what you decided 3 days later?**

The Debrief Machine is an AI session management system that captures value before it disappears.

## The Problem You Have (But Didn't Realize Was Solvable)

**Scenario 1: The Lost Insight**
- Had incredible 3-hour Claude session last week
- Made brilliant architecture decisions
- Today, can't remember what you decided
- Spend 20 minutes searching conversation history
- Give up, just re-ask Claude

**Scenario 2: The Context Disaster**
- Working on 5 different AI-assisted projects
- Switch between them constantly (ADHD gang rise up)
- Every time you return to a project: "Wait, where was I?"
- Re-read entire conversation to get context
- Productivity destroyed

**Scenario 3: The Re-Work Tax**
- Solved complex problem with ChatGPT last month
- Same problem appears this month
- Can't find original solution
- Spend 2 hours re-solving what you already solved
- Feel like Sisyphus

**You're paying $20-40/month for AI tools. You're keeping maybe 20% of the value.**

## The Solution: Systematic Session Debriefing

At the end of each AI session, paste a debrief prompt. The AI summarizes itself.

**You get:**
- 800-word structured summary (vs 8,000-word conversation)
- Scannable sections (find insight in 30 seconds, not 20 minutes)
- Decision log with rationale (know WHY you chose this approach)
- Action items (prioritized, ready to execute)
- Next session starter (paste into future chat, instant context)

**Time investment:** 2 minutes per session
**Time saved later:** 15-30 minutes per reference
**Break-even:** After 1-2 debriefed sessions

## FAQ

A: No. Just text prompts you paste into AI chat interfaces. Works with Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, any AI tool.

**Q: How long does debriefing take?**
A: 2-3 minutes. Copy prompt, paste, AI generates debrief, save output. That's it.
