## KEY INSIGHTS YOU SHOULD REMEMBER

### Insight 1: This is About Validation, Not Revenue
- Free lite version goal: Prove market exists
- Not: Make $1,000 month 1
- Reality check: $200-400/month Year 1 is realistic with effort
- Why free version: Validates market with zero risk

### Insight 2: The Upgrade Path Matters
- Free shows: Core value (you CAN debrief sessions)
- Free shows limits: You WANT ChatGPT version, auto-detection, etc.
- Paid shows: Full power (10x more content + features)
- This creates natural upgrade motivation

### Insight 3: Distribution is Organic, Not Paid
- No paid ads needed
- Reddit + GitHub + email = 600-1,350 downloads
- All zero-dollar channels
- Bootstrap friendly approach

### Insight 4: Speed Beats Perfection
- 25 hours gets you to market
- 100+ hours of perfection = wasted time if no market
- Launch in 2 weeks, iterate based on feedback
- Real users give better feedback than assumptions

### Insight 5: Email List is the Real Asset
- Free downloads = customers you might lose
- Email list = customers you OWN
- Gumroad captures emails automatically
- This list becomes foundation for product suite

## COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: Should I include the full v3.0 as the "lite" version?**
A: No. If you include everything, users won't upgrade. Include 3 core prompts (30% of value) so upgrade path is clear.

**Q: Should I charge for the lite version?**
A: No. Charge in paid version. Free is lead magnet. (See "Lite Version Economics" in strategy doc)

**Q: Which 3 prompts should I pick?**
A: Strategy doc recommends: Universal + Claude + ADHD. This hits primary market (AI power users) + secondary market (ADHD workers).

**Q: What if someone just uses the free version forever?**
A: That's fine! Not everyone will upgrade. Your goal: 2-5% of free users eventually pay. That's success.

**Q: Can I launch on PromptBase instead of Gumroad?**
A: PromptBase caps prices at $9.99 (you want $29 at least). Gumroad is better. GitHub + Gumroad combo is ideal.

**Q: Should I promote this more aggressively (paid ads)?**
A: Not in week 1. Get organic traction first. If 50+ downloads from organic channels, then test small paid campaign ($50).

**Q: What if people say it's "just 3 prompts" for free?**
A: Position it as "3 CORE prompts" (the most essential, high-value ones). Full version has "30+ prompts" (nice to have extras). Frame as power users wanting extras, not value deficiency.

**Q: How do I handle people asking for the ChatGPT version in the free tier?**
A: "ChatGPT version is in the paid version ($29) along with Perplexity and 30+ other prompts. Free version has the universal prompt that works with ChatGPT too!" Turns objection into upgrade prompt.
