## 🛡️ **ANTI-TRUNCATION DESIGN FEATURES**

### **Systematic Chunking Strategy**
Instead of one massive artifact, create focused components:

| Artifact Focus | Content Scope | Size Management |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Master Overview** | Executive summary + roadmap | ~2000 words max |
| **Reference System** | Unified [1]-[N] numbering | ~1500 words max |
| **Research Framework** | Strategic questions + analysis | ~1500 words max |
| **Deliverables Tracker** | Complete future work mapping | ~1500 words max |
| **Quality Report** | Compliance + improvement results | ~1500 words max |

### **Cross-Artifact Integration**
- Each artifact references others for seamless navigation
- Master overview provides complete roadmap to all components
- Consistent numbering and terminology across all pieces
- Individual artifacts are complete and actionable independently

### **Progressive Enhancement Approach**
1. **Start with overview** - Establish scope and priorities
2. **Build core components** - References, research, deliverables
3. **Add quality layers** - Compliance, improvements, verification
4. **Integrate and cross-reference** - Ensure seamless workflow
