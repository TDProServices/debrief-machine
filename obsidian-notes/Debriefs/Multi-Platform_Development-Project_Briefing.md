# The Debrief Machine Multi-Platform Development — Project Briefing

## 🌟 **Executive Summary**

**Purpose**: Develop platform-optimized versions of The Debrief Machine prompt for Claude, ChatGPT, and Perplexity with enhanced features including artifact tracking, model detection, and anticipatory research queues.

**Current Status**: All three platform versions (v2.0.1) successfully created and optimized with platform-specific capabilities.

**Key Wins**:

- **Claude version excels** with comprehensive artifact tracking and tool usage documentation
- **ChatGPT version enhanced** with reasoning chains and creative formatting despite Canvas reliability issues
- **Perplexity version optimized** for research integration and source verification
- **Anticipatory research queue** added to predict future investigation needs
- **Model detection** integrated across all platforms

**Challenges**:

- **ChatGPT Canvas has systematic reliability issues** including context corruption and "AI amnesia" behaviors
- **Version numbering confusion** resolved by standardizing all to v2.0.1
- **Cross-platform feature parity** requires platform-specific optimizations
