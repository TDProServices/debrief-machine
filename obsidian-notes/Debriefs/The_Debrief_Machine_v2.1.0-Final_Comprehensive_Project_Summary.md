## 🔧 **TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS**

### **Versioning Logic**
```
Per-Project Sequence:
- First debrief in project = v1.0
- Second debrief in same chat = v1.1
- First debrief in new chat = v2.0
- Continue incrementing per project

Detection Method:
1. Search project knowledge: "debrief version project briefing"
2. Search current chat: "briefing v" OR "version"
3. Apply increment logic automatically
4. Add ISO timestamp for searchability
```

### **Auto-Trigger Scoring**
```
High Confidence (15+ points) = Auto-generate
- "I'm done" / "Let's wrap up" (5 pts)
- 3+ artifacts created (4 pts)
- Milestone completion (3 pts)
- Project delivery confirmation (3 pts)

Medium Confidence (8-14 points) = Ask permission
- 2+ artifacts created (3 pts)
- Major decisions made (2 pts)
- "That looks good" responses (2 pts)
- Next steps defined (2 pts)
```

## 🎓 **USER IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE**

### **Immediate Deployment Steps**
1. **Upload all 6 artifacts** to your Claude Project
2. **Test the auto-trigger system** with a sample conversation  
3. **Verify version detection** by checking project knowledge search
4. **Validate timestamp functionality** for searchability

### **Getting Started**
1. **For First Use**: Start with Claude Project Edition for full features
2. **For Simplicity**: Use 8-section simplified version if 23 sections feel overwhelming
