## 🔧 **CONFLICT DETECTION METHODOLOGY**

### **Auto-Analysis Triggers**
For each section, systematically check:
- "What claims contradict each other?"
- "Where is information incomplete or ambiguous?"
- "What assumptions lack verification?"
- "Which sources disagree on key points?"
- "What terminology is unclear or inconsistent?"
- "What critical information is missing?"

### **Information Quality Scoring (1-10)**
- **9-10**: Multiple verified sources, no conflicts, clear definitions
- **7-8**: Good sources, minor conflicts resolved, mostly clear
- **5-6**: Some verification, manageable conflicts, some ambiguity
- **3-4**: Limited verification, significant conflicts, unclear areas
- **1-2**: Unverified, major conflicts, high ambiguity

### **Priority Conflict Categories**
- **Critical**: Affects core project decisions or evidence
- **High**: Impacts strategy or timeline significantly
- **Medium**: Creates inefficiency or confusion
- **Low**: Minor clarity issues or preference conflicts

END PROMPT - Generate numbered artifact immediately
