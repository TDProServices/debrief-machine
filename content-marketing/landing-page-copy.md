### HERO SECTION

**Headline (H1):**
# Stop Forgetting Your Best AI Conversations

**Hero CTA:**

**Visual:** Screenshot of before/after (messy 8,000-word conversation vs clean structured debrief)

### PROBLEM SECTION (Agitate the Pain)

**Section Headline:**
## You're Paying $20-40/Month for AI Tools. Are You Actually Keeping The Value?

**Pain Points (3 columns):**

**The Forgetful AI User**
You've had 100+ amazing AI conversations. You can remember about 5% of them. The rest disappeared into the void the moment you closed the tab.

**The Serial Re-Solver**
You solved that complex problem with ChatGPT last month. This month, you're solving it again because you can't find the original solution. ADHD tax is brutal.

**The Context Archaeology Disaster**
You need to reference that 12,000-word strategic planning session from 2 weeks ago. You spend 20 minutes scrolling, skimming, searching... and still can't find the key insight.

**Bold Statement:**
**The conversation isn't the value. The conversation you can actually USE later is the value.**

---

### SOLUTION SECTION

**Section Headline:**
## Meet The Debrief Machine

**Subheadline:**
A prompt framework that makes AI conversations actually useful 3 days later.

**How It Works (3 steps with icons):**

**1. Have Your AI Session**
Work with Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, or any AI tool on whatever project/problem you have. Nothing changes in your workflow.

**2. Run the Debrief Prompt**
At the end of your session, copy-paste the debrief prompt. Takes 2 minutes. The AI summarizes itself into a structured, scannable format.

**3. Reference It Later**
When you need to remember what you decided, read the 800-word structured debrief instead of re-reading the 8,000-word conversation. Find insights in 30 seconds, not 20 minutes.

### BEFORE/AFTER SECTION

**Section Headline:**
## The Difference Is Ridiculous

**Two-Column Comparison:**

### WITHOUT Debrief Machine ❌

**Session:** 2-hour AI conversation about API architecture (6,500 words)

**3 days later, colleague asks:** "What authentication approach did we decide on?"

- Skim multiple sections
- Miss key decision
- Give incomplete/uncertain answer
- Look unprepared

**Time wasted:** 15-20 minutes
**Accuracy:** ~60%
**Confidence:** Low
**Frustration:** High

### WITH Debrief Machine ✅

**Session:** Same 2-hour conversation, but you ran debrief prompt at the end (2 minutes)

**3 days later, same question**

**Your experience:**
- Open debrief file
- Scan "Decisions Made" section
- Find exact answer with full context
- Share complete rationale
- Look like you have it together

**Time to answer:** 45 seconds
**Accuracy:** 100%
**Confidence:** High
**Frustration:** Zero

**Net benefit:** 18 minutes saved + actually useful info

### SOCIAL PROOF SECTION

**Section Headline:**
## What AI Power Users Are Saying

**Testimonial 1:**
> "I've been using Claude Pro for 8 months. I had ~200 sessions in my history and could reference maybe 10% of them usefully. The Debrief Machine completely changed my workflow. I actually *use* my AI work now instead of just having conversations that evaporate."
>
> **- Sarah K., Product Manager**

**Testimonial 2:**
> "ADHD + AI tools = chaos. I'd have brilliant hyperfocused sessions with ChatGPT, then completely forget what I decided the moment I context-switched. This system is external working memory. It's the first time I've maintained context across multiple AI projects without losing my mind."
>
> **- Marcus T., Software Engineer (ADHD)**

**Testimonial 3:**
> "As a legal researcher, I need to document AI-assisted analysis for client work. The Legal Research Edition templates are exactly what I needed. Saves me 2-3 hours per research project on post-session documentation alone."
>
> **- Jennifer L., Legal Research Analyst**

### FAQ SECTION

**Section Headline:**
## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is this exactly?**
A: A collection of text prompts you copy-paste into AI chat interfaces. The AI reads the prompt and generates a structured summary of your conversation. Think of it as a framework for making AI conversations more organized and reusable.

**Q: Does this work with my AI tool?**
A: Yes. Works with Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and any AI that can follow structured instructions. Platform-specific editions are optimized for each tool's unique features, but the universal prompts work everywhere.

**Q: Do I need special software?**
A: No. This is just text prompts. Copy-paste into your AI chat interface. No installation, no plugins, no technical setup required.

**Q: How long does the debrief take?**
A: 2-3 minutes. Copy prompt, paste into chat, AI generates debrief, save output. That's it.

**Q: Is this worth it for short AI sessions?**
A: Probably not. Debriefs are most valuable for sessions over 2,000 words where you made decisions or created artifacts you'll need later. Quick Q&A sessions don't need formal debriefs.

**Q: Can I try before I buy?**
A: Absolutely. The Free Lite Edition includes the core universal prompts. Try it on a few sessions. If it saves you time, consider upgrading to the full collection.

**Q: What if I don't like it?**
A: 30-day money-back guarantee. If the full collection doesn't save you time or improve your AI workflow, just email and I'll refund you. No questions asked.

**Q: Do you offer team/enterprise pricing?**
A: For teams of 5+ people, email tanya@tdproservices.com for volume pricing.

**Q: Will this work if I have ADHD?**
A: Yes! The ADHD-Friendly Edition (included in full collection) is specifically designed for ADHD users. Extra visual hierarchy, simplified structure, context restoration optimized for working memory limits. Created by an ADHD user (me) who needed this badly.

**Q: What makes this different from just "taking notes"?**
A: The AI does the work. Instead of manually summarizing an 8,000-word conversation (executive dysfunction says no), you paste a prompt and the AI structures the summary for you. It's the difference between "I should organize this" and "It's already organized."

**Q: Lifetime access? Or subscription?**
A: One-time payment. Lifetime access. All future updates included. No subscription, no recurring fees.

**Q: Is there support?**
A: Free/Standard: Documentation and email support for technical issues. Pro/Complete: Implementation guidance, customization help, and private community access.
